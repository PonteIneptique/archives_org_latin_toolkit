PREFACE

It seems right to preface a new edition of the Pro
Cluentio of Cicero with something in the nature of an
explanation. Professor Ramsay&apos;s book has so long
and so deservedly held a high place among EngHsh
editions of the Classics, that any subsequent editor of
this speech may well expect to be told that the field
has already been taken up.

But greatly as the present work is indebted to its
forerunner, it will be found to have a character of its
own. In the first place, as I have stated more fully
elsewhere, I have adopted a text substantially identical
with that of Classen, in preference to the reactionary
text of Professor Ramsay. Again, in legal and anti-
quarian matters, while frequently referring to his useful
Manual of Roman Antiquities as well as to his Notes,
I have drawn largely upon recent German authorities
for the elucidation of the difficulties in which this
speech abounds. Lastly, much entirely fresh matter,
from various sources, is comprised, in the way of

VI

PREFACE.

illustration from Cicero (who is often his own best
commentator), and of grammatical annotation. And
here I have frequently laid Merguet&apos;s Lexicon to the
Speeches under contribution.

The book is designed for the use of more advanced
students, whether in the Sixth Form of a Public School
or at the University. No single speech is better
adapted than is the Pro Cluentio to afford a perfect
mastery of Ciceronian idiom and vocabulary. Refer-
ence has been made throughout to Mr. Roby&apos;s Gram-
mars : a feature of the work which should enhance its
value in the eyes of those who have a real interest in
Syntax. With regard to vocabulary, the Glossary
should be useful to those who will extend it for them-
selves. It does not pretend to exhaust even the
limited number of noteworthy words which occur in
this speech : it merely exemplifies, in the case of some
typical words, a method of studying word-meanings
according to their genesis.

I have been somewhat chary of giving scraps of
translation, partly because practical experience in
teaching has convinced me that indiscriminate help
of this sort enervates the learner, and reduces his task
to a mere exercise of memory ; partly because those
who cannot dispense with such help, and those who
know how to usc it aright, will get it in its proper form

which also I desire to record my obligations.

It remains that I should express my hearty thanks
to Professor H. Nettleship, at whose suggestion, indeed,
this edition was undertaken, for some notes and help
upon part of the proof-sheets, and for much kind
counsel ; to Mr. H. J. Roby for his untiring kindness
in carefully revising the proof-sheets of the whole book
(with the exception of part of the Critical Notes), and
for the many valuable notes and criticisms which he
has supplied ; to Mr. J. A. Hamilton, Fellow of Mag-

appears under his name in the Introduction ; and
lastly, to Mr. J. H. Fowler, of Trinity CoUege, Oxford,

INTRODUCTION

T. The Trial of A. Cluentius Habitus : the Charges

INCLUDED I^ THE InDICTMENT AND THE LAW UPON
WHICH IT RESTED. ReMARKS ON THE SpEECH OF
ClCERO IN HIS DEFENCE.

§ I. This trial took place in the year of Cicero&apos;s praetorship,
B.c. 66, before Q. Voconius Naso, who as iudex quaestionis
presided in the Assassination Court {quaestio de sicariis et
ve?ieficis), an office which was no singcure at a time when the
social and moral anarchy of Rome was tending rapidly to
poUtical chaos.

Aulus Cluentius Habitus, a Roman knight of Larinum, an
ItaHan township on the northern border of ApuHa, was
accused by C. Oppianicus of having procured the death of
several persons by poisoning. These persons were —

1. Vibius Cappadox, whose heir (it was alleged) Cluentius
was.

2. A young man named Balbutius, who took a draught of
poisoned wine intended for his friend C. Oppianicus (the
younger), at the wedding-breakfast of the latter.

3. Statius Albius Oppianicus the elder, father of the
prosecutor Oppianicus the younger, and stepfather of the
defendant Cluentius.

§ 2. But the counsel for the prosecution, a young advocate
of Pisaurum, T. Accius by name, also made great capital out
of the general conviction that Cluentius had, eight years
before this date, secured the condemnation of ©ppianicus
the elder by bribing the jury. In the lex Cornelia de sicariis
et veneficis^ which was administered by the quaestio before
which Cluentius was tried, a special clause existed, deahng
with this offence as &apos;judicial murder.&apos; True, this clause
appUed only to those who were senators, or who held or had
held magistracies by popular election : and therefore, tech-

b

X INTRODUCTION.

nically at least, Cluentius was not liable under it.^ But
there are good reasons for believing that Accius accused
Cluentius not merely collaterally, but expressly under this
clause of the statute in question, as well as under the
poisoning clause. We shall discuss this point more fuUy
hereafter.

§ 3. This speech was deUvered when Cicero was forty-one
years of age. He was in the prime of life and intellectual vigour,
and had risen by his own unaided talents and energy to a
high position in pubHc life. Not only was he acknowledged
leader of the bar; he was also a force in politics, a champion
of the Equestrian order (the powerful middle class of that
day). As such, four years since, he had crushed the sena-
torial arch-criminal Verres by his irresistible eloquence, and
in this very year had contributed not a little by his speech
pro lege Manilia ^ to the success of the rogation which super-
seded LucuUus, the senatorial general, by Cn. Pompeius, at
this time the leader of the Equites.

As yet, moreover, he had known no rebuffs and no humiha-
tion : his triumph over Verres, against whom he levels a
passing word of contempt in this speech, if it was not executed
on as grand a scale as his defeat of CatiUne, had not left
behind it any sting of misgiving as to the possible consequences
to himself of his action. It had left him the reg?ium iudicioruvi.
He had every reason to be satisfied with the past and to be
sanguine as to the future. For his ambition naturally did
not end with the praetorship : the wave of fortune was not
hkely to ebb until it had carried him to the consulship.
He also occupied the chief place among the literary men of
the capital. In proof of this, it is enough to say that Cicero
had successfuUy combated the &apos; Asiatic style&apos; ofQ. Hortensius
and the &apos; Attic style &apos; of C. Licinius Calvus (the former the
style of his own youthful productions, especially the pro
Quinctio and pro Rosc. Am.)^ and formed an eclectic style
which was truly his own, and acknowledged to be the best.

§ 4. After these considerations we shall not be surprised
to find that the style of this speech is characterised, as far
as the nature of the subject will admit, by all the highest
quaUties of the oratory of the speaker. We shall presently
have to estimate the persuasive adroitness which could
construct out of a confusing mass of facts and figments, plots

^ §§ 148, 150, 156. Or. deimpcrio Cn. Poinpeii.

INTRODUCTION. xi

and counterplots, a coherent narrative with a dramatic unity
of its own ; in which the innocent Cluentius is the suffering
hero, while Sassia his unnatural mother, and Oppianicus his
stepfather, take the second and third role respectively in the
drama of his sorrows. But we also recognise in the dark
portrait of Oppianicus the work of the master-hand which
afterwards Hmned the features of Catiline ; and in fact a
series of vivid pictures, often drawn in a few strong touches,
passes before our eyes : the fearless Aurius denouncing the
murderer of his kinsman in the crowded market-place of
Larinum : the weak-headed profligate Asuvius and his
traitorous friend : the travelUng quack L. Clodius, who made
short work of his patients when he was in a hurry, but was
always successful in his own peculiar treatment : Ambivius,
the innkeeper of the Latin Way : &apos; Doctor &apos; Strato : and
several others.

The course of the speech is enHvened with frequent
narrative, in which humour and pathos are skilfully blended
with the argument which the advocate wishes to drive home.
Thus when he is describing the trial of Scamander, the ac-
complice of Oppianicus, whom he had himself defended, he
diverts the jury — in the Hteral sense of the word — by a playful
account of his youthful nervousness as he rose to speak, the
shifts to which he was reduced in such a desperate case, and
the ease with which the counsel for the prosecution disposed
of them. While we laugh, we forget to criticise. Comparing
this passage with a similar one in Rosc. Am. §§ 59, 60, we
seem to see in itafinish and force and verve which is wanting
in the earHer narrative : this is due to the more successful
appHcation of the asyndetic style. The superb narration
of the^ trial of Oppianicus requires no praise : Staienus,
conscript father, briefless barrister, and law-court jobber,
gloating over the hoarded gold which was not yet his own,
and with a stroke of genius devising means to make it so ;
Bulbus and Gutta, his dupes, the worthy pair over whose
names (&apos;Messrs. Onion and Cruet&apos;) Cicero makes so merry;
and the final confusion of counsels among honest men. Even
if Cicero is romancing, it is perhaps a case in which fiction
gives us a better insight into the spirit of the times than
truth would have done.

Again, the historical iUustrations, such as the episodes of
the review of P. Africanus the censor (in § 134), and of the
aUercation of Brutus and Crassus (in §§ 140, 141), remind

xii INTRODUCTION.

us, by the skill with which they are introduced, of the style of
Cicero&apos;s later philosophical works.

Lastly, for passion and scathing irony few passages in the
whole range of literature will compare with the magnificent
bursts of eloquence which are to be found in this speech, such
as the denunciation of Sassia&apos;s marriage with her son-in-law
(§ 15), and the peroration in which she is held up to detesta-
tion as &apos;the wife of her son-in-law, the illicit rival of her
daughter, the stepmother of the son of her womb.&apos;

§ 5. We must then dissent from an able critic who declares
that the Cluentiana &apos; is not a favourable specimen of Cicero&apos;s
oratorical power : there is no connection in the events ; there
is no order of time. We are hurried from date to date, from
place to place. The same person is described under different
names ; the same incident in different words. The result is a
mass of threads so knotted, twisted, and entangled, that only
patient labour can sort them out into intelHgible arrange-
ment.&apos;i There may be much intricacy in the story which
Cicero tells ; confusion there is none, and those critics who
find it are merely finding what they have themselves intro-
duced.

The historical value of the speech cannot be exaggerated.
It is inYact unique in this respect, that it gives us a gfimpse,
which cannot elsewhere be obtained, of the life and morals of
a provincial town of Italy in the last century of the Repubhc.
We know something about the moral and social condition of
the capital from various contemporary sources, which are too
famihar to need enumeration. Sallust (to take one instance)
tells us how the nobler vice of ambition was succeeded by a
lust for gold, and a passion for self-indulgence, which bred
crimes scarcely human ; from him we may learn that at Rome
reformed institutions and laws were powerless to arrest moral
decay — &apos;quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?&apos; (Hor.
C. iii. 24. 35.) But the story of Cluentius and Oppianicus is
a most valuable supplement to this. As it was in Rome, so it
was in Italy. If Rome had a Sempronia, an AureHa Orestilla,
aFulvia,- Larinum had a Sassia, as wicked and as beautiful as
they. The virtue of old Italy was as obsolete as that of old
Rome. Sulla himself could not repair what he had done as

^ &apos; Society in Italy in the Last Days of the Roman Republic,&apos; in Mr.
Frouile&apos;s Short Studies, iii. (The account of the facts is somewhat mis-
leading. )

INTRODUCTION. xiii

much as any man living to demolish. Republican Rome had
been tried and found wanting. It was reserved for the
Caesars to prop up for a few centuries longer the tottering
fabric of the Empire ; there was strength and soundness in
the provinces still. But for the moral diseases of their people
the rulers could do little ; they could &apos; but skin and film the
ulcerous place.&apos; The cause of truth and purity was in the
keeping of a Greater than Caesar and of His obscure Jewish
foUowers.

II. Was Cluentius accused under the Sixth Chapter
OF THE lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis ?

§ I. At the outset of the speech Cicero notes that the
speech for the prosecution was divided into two parts, the
one relating to a pubHc scandal with which his cHent&apos;s name
had for years been unjustly associated — the alleged bribery of
the jurors in the trial of Oppianicus {invidia iani inveterata
iudicii Iwiiafii), the other lightly touching upon the charges
of poisoning {rationem veneficii criminu7n). The same division
he proposes to adopt in his speech. Not counting the intro-
duction and peroration, very nearly seven-eighths of the speech
(leals with what he calls the invidia iudicii luniani or Cluen-
tianae pecu7iiae crijimi}

% 2. The lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis^ passed by Sulla,
covered both parts of the impeachment, though primarily it
related to murder and assassination.

For seven centuries there had existed only one instrument
for deahng with this crime — the law of Numa ?iho\it parricide
(quoted and explained in n. on parricidiu77i, § 31) : according
to Pomponius de orig. iuris (Dig. i, 2, § 22), the quaestores
parricidii who administered it were mentioned in the Laws of
the Twelve Tables ; and any cases of murder that occurred
were dealt with in their court (Rein, Cri^ninalr. p. 401). But the
party struggles and civil strife which had distracted Italy from
the time of the reforming efforts of the Gracchi, and which
had raged continuously and with heightened violence from
the time of the Social War, culminating in the massacres and
proscriptions of Marius and Sulla, had produced a state of
morals appaUing to contemplate. Sulla found himself called

xiv INTRODUCTION.

upon to heal the social as well as the political disorders of
the commonwealth, and he now stood before his countrymen
in a fresh character, as the founder of the criminal law and
criminal procedure of Rome. Foremost among the measures
by which he hoped to consoUdate his new era, and by &apos;human
statute purge the gentle weal,&apos; was the law of murder — the lex
Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis.

For its provisions this speech of Cicero&apos;s is our principal
authority. There are notices also in the lawyers, but in these
it is not ahvays easy to distinguish the original statute from its
subsequent modifications.

SuUa had also, as Cicero informs us, embodied in this law a
measure of C. Gracchus against judicial corruption on the
part of senators.i Under this law C. Gracchus had consti-
tuted a new quaestio.

§ 3. It will be well to give a brief sketch of this law of Sulla,
as far as the materials for the purpose avail us.

The First Chapter ^ related {a) to murderers and assassins
under the general name ^/f«r//;^ (^) to those who had gone
about armed with the intent to rob or murder; {c) to the
instigator of a murder. In each case the presence of an
intent to take life is essential.

The same or other chapters dealt with the crimes of arson,
of seUing a Roman citizen into slavery,^ and of parricide : ^
and also with that of perjury ^ committed with intent to

^ V. § 154, ea lege qua nunc Habitus accusatur, quae tunc erat Sempro-
nia, nunc est Cornelia; § 151, hanc ipsam legem ne quis lUDlCiO CIR-
CUMVENIRETUR, C. Gracchus tulit, with note there.

** In this extreme case, the original punishment was drowning in a sack ;
apparently this punishment was nominally allowed but practically super-
seded by burning alive, by the lex Pompeia de pai-ricidis. Cp. Ulp. Dig.
xlviii. 9, 1. I ; 1. 9 and 8, 1. 3, § 5 ; Paul. Sent. v. 24.

The lex Cornelia de iniuriis (Ulp. Dig. xlvii. 10, 1. 5), which the
violence of the times had also necessitated, was probably a separate
statute, though Zumpt beUeves that it was a chapter of the lex de sicariis.

spcaks as if it were restricted in the rangeof its application like chaptervi.

bring a man to his death : and also (possibly) with other
acts committed with the same intent^

The Fifth Chapter, mider which Cluentius was primarily
accused, related to those who had aided and abetted poisoning
by supplying the means.^ Compare with this Chapter i. of
the same law.

Lastly, the Sixth Chapter (incorporating, as we have seen,
the law of C. Gracchus) dealt with what we may call judicial
murder, and applied to all who should have conspired or
combined to procure the condemnation in court of an in-
nocent man, or should (acting in the capacity of judge or
juror) have received a bribe for that purpose (the reference
is doubtless to misconduct in criminal, not civil courts). And
the peculiarity of this last chapter was that its appHcation was
restricted to those who had a seat in the senate, or held
or had held a magistracy by choice of the people. Of the
existence of this restriction there is ample evidence.^

§ 4. The question now arises : Was Cluentius a Roman
Knight expressly accused under the sixth chapter of the lex
Cornelia de sicariis ?

It is certain that whether he was so accused or not, Cicero
intended to convey the impression that he was, and a whole
section of the speech (§§ 143-160) is devoted to a technical
defence, which, at the same time, he ostentatiously, in defer-
ence, forsooth, to the wishes of his cHent, waives his right to
make.

We must however be on our guard against an implicit

Dig. xlviii. 8. i). Probably Cicero is speaking correctly for his own
period, and the jurists of the Digest speak of the lex Cornelia as it was
modified in imperial times. This hypothesis is rendered likely by the
context in the Digest, which speaks of deportatio (an imperial punishment)
as the penalty threatened. The original penalty under the law was
&apos; aquae et ignis interdictio.&apos;

^ Lex CorneHa poenam deportationis infligit ei qui hominem occiderit
eiusve rei causa furtive faciendi cum telo fuerit et qui venenum hominis
necandi causa habuerit vendiderit paraverit falsumve testimonium dixerit,
quo quis periret, mortisve causam praestiterit (Paul. Sent. rec. v. 23. i).
. &apos; § 148.

^ An extract in the Digest from Marcian {Dig. xlviii. 8. i) gives the
general meaning of this part of the law (altered to suit the time of
Justinian) : &apos; quive, cum magistratus esset publicove iudicio praeesset,
operam dedisset, quo quis falsum iudicium profiteretur, ut innocens
circumveniretur, condemnaretur. Praeterea tenetur qui . . . falsum testi-
monium dolo malo dixerit quo quis pubhco iudicio rei capitaHs damnaretur ;
quive magistratus iudexve quaestionis ob capitalem causam pecuniam
acceperit, ut pubHca lege reus fieret. &apos;

xvi INTRODUCTION.

acceptance of the orator&apos;s statements. We must remember
his own warning, twice given ; once in the coiirse of this very
speech (§ 139) — sed errat vehementer, si quis in orationibus
nostris, quas in iudiciis habuimus, auctoritates nostras con-
signatas se habere arbitratur : omnes enim illae causarum ac
temporum sunt, non hominum ipsorum ac patronorum ; and
again by the boast which Quintihan tells us he made in regard
to this speech — se tenebras offudisse iudicibus in causaCluenti,
&apos; that he had thrown dust into the eyes of the jurors on the
trial of Cluentius.&apos;

§ 5. Now, it would be open to us at the outset to suppose
that Cicero has misstated the lex Cornelia\ that in fact
Cluentius was hable under the Sixth Chapter, and was accused
under it, but that Cicero, while defending him on the question of
fact, has affirmed falsely that the provision in question related
only to senators, and taken credit to his cHent for not resting
his case on this technical basis. And indeed on another point
(v. note 5, p. xiv.) he has been taxed with misquotation.

But enough has been said above to show that Cicero cannot
be convicted, on the ground of anythingin the Digest, of having
misstated the lex Cornelia de sic. et ven. as it stood in his own
day.

§ 6. Two (if not more) recent students of this speech, Dr.
Carl Bardt and Mr. Davies, have taken up different positions.
T. Accius, they say, had only accused Cluentius under the
poisoning clauses of the lex Cornelia, although wihing to take
advantage to the fuU of his moral (though not legal) violation
of the Sixth Chapter, on judicial murder : Cicero talks as if he
were being actually tried under that chapter. Bardt has
stated this position as forcibly as it can be stated, and a
review of his main arguments cannot here be neglected.

From what has been said, it will be apparent that the
orator is now accused of misrepresenting, by quotation, not the
terms of the law, but those of the indictment actually pre-
ferred against Cluentius. And Bardt tries to show that this
is done with a subtle ambiguity of expression, to which only
the greatest orators have attained.

{a) To begin with, there is the careful division of the case
against Cluentius into invidia and crimina : a distinction
drawn in the exordium of the speech, constituting its natural
hne of cleavage, and reappearing in the antithesis oi falsa
invidia dXidi pericula at its close (§ 200).

{p) In the transition to the section relating to the charges of

INTRODUCTION. xvii

poisoning, Cicero twice uses ambiguous words : § 1 60, reliqua
(these charges as opposed to that of bribery) quia vestrae
quaestioiiis erant^ proferenda ; § 164, cognoscite nunc id, quod
ad vestrum ius iurandum pertinet, quod vestri iudicii est . . .
de criminibus veneni. That is, the charge of bribery is &apos; non
vestrae quaestionis, non vestri iudicii &apos; : &apos; you have not before
you the bribery charge.&apos; And why not ? The true answer is,
because it is not a count in the indictment ; but this would be
inconsistent with the tenor of the speech, and the jurors are
meant to understand the words thus — &apos; because such questions
do not fall under the cognisance of your court.&apos;

{c) But there are also many isolated expressions carefuUy
chosen so as to mislead. When speaking of the bribery
charge, Cicero prefers the vague phrase causam obtinere
(§§ ^45) 156) to the usual term, absolvi (contrast absolvatis
of a hypothetical parallel, § 158), and prefers to introduce the
charge itself by dicitur., dicitis, and the Hke indefinite expres-
sions (§§ 9, 39, 88, 90, 138), whereas the charges of poisoning
are introduced by dicis or dixisti.

Again, the word lex is ambiguous ; it may denote either
the whole law or the Sixth Chapter alone : § 154, ilh (equites)
non hoc recusabant, ne ea lege accusarentur, qua nunc Habi-
tus accusatur, quae tunc erat Sempronia, nunc est Corneha :
intellegebant enim ea lege equestrem ordinem non teneri.
So § 156: A. Cluentius causam dicit eques Romanus ea lege,
qua senatores, cet.

{d) Lastly, there is the difficulty of understanding how the
prosecution could have impeached Cluentius under a statute
under which they knew that he was not amenable.

§ 7- Cicero was doubtless fully capable of the chicanery
which is here attributed to him. Of that the Cluentiana will
afford ample evidence. But the indictment which Dr. Bardt
brings against him, while strong on the side which ancient
rhetoricians would have called the &apos; probabile ex vita,&apos; is not
so strong in the &apos;probabile ex causa.&apos; If we take his last argu-
ment first, it is outweighed by a difficulty on the other side :
could Cicero have dehberately imposed upon a Roman jury
as to the counts&apos; comprised in the indictment? One juror,
who had kept his eyes open, might have exposed the glaring
sophism, and the advocate&apos;s credit would have been ruined,

Next, if we take the other arguments seriatim, their cumu-
lative force is considerable, but they will not all bear an indi-
vidual scrutiny. As to («), why should not the orator have

xviii INTRODUCTION.

consistently used the most invidious term he could find to
characterise the charge which he felt to be the best authenti-
cated? And in §§ 8, 125, the latter too appesLVS as crimen,
Cluentianae pecwiiae crimen.

As to (^), the jurors must have all belonged to the country
tribes, if Cicero could reckon upon their beHeving that such
questions (as that of judicial corruption) did not &apos;fall under
the cognisance of their court.&apos; Whereas, upon the view which
I hope shortly to propound, a good sense is given : &apos; the
charge of bribery against Cluentius, a Roman K^iight (be it
remembered), is one which does not concern your court,
which does not fall within the scope of the lex Cornelia which
that court administers, and which consequently you are not
by your oath bound to investigate.&apos; The orator in fact takes
his stand, despite his disclaimer, on the letter of Chap. vi. of
the lex Cornelia.

As to (r), the distinction of usage in the speech is not so
consistent that much importance can be attached to it. It is
neglected in § 165, in § 168, and in §§ 169, 183, where obiectum
est, dixistis, dicitis severally appear in connection with the
charges of poisoning.

But it is when Cicero speaks of haec lex, ea lex, that the ad-
vocate of this theory is reduced to his worst shifts. In § 116,
&apos;hac lege ipsa,&apos; upon any natural interpretation, refers to the
Sixth Chapter of the lex Cornelia, and in §§ 154, 156 Cicero
says outright that Cluentius was accused, is pleading his case,
under the Sixth Chapter of the lex Cornelia. Here then we
must suppose him to have passed from prevarication of a
somewhat clumsy sort to absolute untruth. For it is idle to
urge that the latter of the objectionable passages is preceded
and followed by perversions of fact. The issue is simple :
&apos; A. Cluentius causam dicit eques Romanus ea lege, qua lege
senatores et ei, qui magistratum habuerunt, soH tenentur.&apos; If
this is not true, it is what the orator himself would have styled
&apos; magnum et impudens mendacium.&apos;

§ 8. Two other views may be noticed, which in one respect
accord with that of Dr. Bardt : in so far as they too suppose
that Cicero wished to misrepresent the terms of the indict-
ment.

Zumpt 1 supposes that the main charge against Cluentius
really was that of bribery in the trial of Oppianicus : it was pre-

^ Criniinalr. ii. 2. 32, 33.

INTRODUCTION. xix

ferred however, hot under Chap. vi. of the lex Cornelia^ but
under the clause mentioned above (p. xv. n. i), for which our
only authority isPaulus — mortisve causam praestiterit — though
Z. refers also to Cic. Phil. ix. 7, is . . . mortem attulit, qui
causa mortis fuit; Quint. vii. 3. 31, 4. 41. This he supposes
immediately followed the clause about &apos; judicial murder,&apos; and
related to all persons without distinction. The question before
the court was the interpretation of this clause — &apos; or has been
the cause of death.&apos; The prosecutor explained it by tbe aid
of the preceding clause. But Cicero spoke as though Cluentius
had been accused under the preceding clause, and had not
much trouble in proving that under it he was not, as a knight,
liable. A similar view may be deduced from the statement
of Rein : ^ except that for the clause quoted by Paulus (which
he assigns to imperial times)^ the clause ^falsMuve testimonium
dixerit &apos; should be substituted. He seems to allow that the
apphcation of the clause about &apos;judicial murder&apos;may have
been a matter of dispute among the lawyers of the time : the
clause about false witnesses, however, applied to all persons
without distinction. We should i^ence infer that Cicero was
misleading the jury when he referred the latter to senators
only.2 Thus in fact he is guilty of a twofold misstatement :
first as to the legal support of the indictment, and secondly as
to the terms of the law.

§ 9. We find ourselves then constrained to fall back on
what is substantially the old view. Cluentius was accused
under both clauses of the lex Cornelia, the fifth and the sixth.
Accius knew that in regard to the former his case was
strong in law and weak in facts, but vice versa in regard to
the latter. By combining the two counts in his indictment he
hoped to ensure a condemnation.

We might consider this proceeding more worthy of a
desultor riding in the Circus Maximus than of an &apos; adulescens
bonus et disertus &apos; addressing a court of law in the Forum.
It seems also singularly unfair that a knight should be charged
under a statute applicable to senatorial jurors for an offence
committed when jurors were still all senators, i.e. before the

^ It is not correct, as Bardt (p. 5) perhaps implies, to credit Rein him-
self with this deduction. He simply says (p. 430) that Cluentius was
accused first of having bribed the Junian commission ; secondly, of having
poisoned Oppianicus.

XX INTRODUCTION.

law of L. Aurelius Cotta, b.c. 70 : that in fact it should be
proposed to make a new interpretation, amounting to an
alteration of the law, retrospective in its action. But in
weighing these objections it must be remembered that the
spirit of Roman justice at this time was not the same as the
spirit of modern law-courts, which is the product of agencies
now many centuries at work. In the interval the whole
structure of Roman law has been reared, of which then
the foundations were barely visible : and generations of
jurists and philosophers have laboured to purify and enlarge
the ideal of justice.^

As to the latter of the preceding objections, we may perhaps
wonder that if Accius really laid himself open to it, Cicero
did not avail himself of it. Probably he felt that it was less
cogent than his main argument, that Cluentius was not, by
the letter of the law, in any way Hable under Chapter vi. For
that argument of course Accius was prepared. We may
suppose that he had anticipated it by a direct negative. He
probably urged that a correct interpretation of the lex Conielia,
as it stood, was sufficient to bring al/ offenders, according
to Chapter vi., including the knight Cluentius, under the scope
of that chapter. This is impHed in § 150, iniquum tibi videtur,
Acci, esse non isdem legibus omnes teneri; § 156, agit sic
causam T. Accius, adulescens bonus et disertus, omnes cives
legibus teneri omnibus. The former of these passages rather
than the latter gives Accius&apos; real words. Again § 145, in-
dignum esse facinus, si senator iudicio quempiam circumvenerit,
legibus eum teneri : si Eques Romanus hoc idem fecerit, non
teneri. In § 160, ne conatus quidem esset dicere, id quod
multis verbis egit, iudicem, qttod ei videatur statuere et non
devinctum legibus esse oportere : these words imply that
Accius had proposed some subjective interpretation of the
letter of the law. And he urged the jurors to condemn
Cluentius, and thereby estabHsh a salutary precedent. His
antagonist was not slow to take up the poHtical gauntlet thus
thrown down.

1 Even novv, too, questions of moral obligation will arise, relating to
advocacy, which cannot be solved off-hand. Cp. some remarks in an
article on &apos; Casuistry &apos; by the Rev. Chancellor Cazenove ( Contemp. Review,
June 1874).

INTRODUCTION. xxi

III. Narrative of the past history of Cluentius and
Oppianicus as it may be gathered from Cicero&apos;s

SPEECH. HOW FAR IS IT TRUSTWORTHY ?

§ I. The intricacy of the plot is certainly the greatest
difficulty which confronts the student who takes up the
Cluentiana for the first time. Hence a careful examir.ation
of the genealogical and other tables to be found in this
Introduction cannot be too earnestly recommended. It may
be well, however, to supplement these by a running narrative
based upon the words of Cicero. Oppianicus has indeed
fared badly in his biographer, whose statements we may here
and there find occasion to criticise, but lack the means to
controvert.

§ 2. A. Cluentius Habitus the elder, father of the defen-
dant, was the leading man in the township and district of
Larinum, in the country of the Frentani, where he died in
B.c. &apos;^Z^ leaving behind him his wife, Sassia, and two children,
a son, A. Ckientius Habitus, and a daughter, Cluentia, the
elder of the two, who soon afterwards married A. Aurius
Mehnus, her first cousin, son of Sassia&apos;s sister. It was a happy
marriage. But here the fatalact of passion intervenes, which
was to open a chapter of horrors, &apos; initium huic cum matre
simultatis &apos; (§ 17). Sassia, who seemed able Hke a Cleopatra
or a Canidia to fascinate and to blast by her imperious beauty,
ahenated the young husband&apos;s affections. He divorced his
wife and married her mother.

§ 3. We are soon introduced to a new actor, whose hostiHty
to the defendant had been as bitter, but less successful, — Statius
Albius Oppianicus the elder, an eqiies of Larinum. It is the
interest of the advocate to depict his character and career in
the darkest colours, so as to estabhsh an &apos;argument from
antecedents &apos; (^probabile ex vita) for his guilt in regard to the
charge of poisoning afterwards brought against him by
Cluentius, and the ilUcit means he took to procure an acquittal.
He is a sort of Roman &apos; Bluebeard &apos; — &apos; homo in necandis uxori-
bus exercitatus,&apos; § 52 : his first wife Cluentia, aunt of the pro-
secutor, he poisoned : the next, Magia, died : the third, Papia,
widow of his brother-in-law Cn. Magius, married him under
very dishonourable circumstances and was divorced by him :
the fourth, Novia, died : last came Sassia. We may notice, as an
incidental proof of the general truthfulness of the details, that

xxii INTRODUCTION.

Cicero does not make nearly so much of Oppianicus&apos; cruelty to
his wives as he might have done : even the expression quoted
above from § 52 is not his own, but that of P. Cannutius, who
opposed him on the trial of Scamander. In fact Cluentia is
the only one of whose end he gives us precise information.

Oppianicus then was about this time charged with the
murder of his brother-in-law, M. Aurius, son of Dinaea, a
wealthy lady of Larinum, and brother of Magia.^ Of her
children, Num. Aurius, Magia, Cn. Magius successively died ;
another, M. Aurius, taken prisoner in the Social War and sold
into slavery, was supposed to be long since dead. Impelled
by insatiate avarice, Oppianicus first secured the reversion
of the inheritance of Cn. Magius to his son by Magia, by
taking practical steps to prevent the accomplishment of the
testator&apos;s desire to bequeath It to his posthumous son. Then,
when the long-lost M. Aurius was reported to be safe and
sound, though in captivity, and his mother in her lonely old
age rejoiced to think that fortune had spared her one of her
children, this bold and wicked man made short work with
her dreams of happiness. One of his agents, L. Clodius, a
travelUng quack, removed Dinaea by a short and sharp
&apos;illness &apos; (as it is called in § 22 : cp. § 40 for a less ironical
account) ; another bribed the informant of Dinaea to mislead
her friends, who were searching the country for M. Aurius ;
and another assassinated M. Aurius, to whom the unfortunate
mother had left a large legacy, bequeathing, however, the bulk
of her property to Oppianicus the younger (son of Oppianicus
and Magia). Thus Oppianicus after a judicious manipulation
of Dinaea&apos;s will, found himself (through his son) sole heir to
the whole property of the unfortunate family whose happiness
he had wrecked, and in whose deaths (it is impHed in § 40,
quo [medico Oppianici] curante suos omnes perdidisset) he
had had a hand. He had now however to reckon with the
friends and relatives of M. Aurius, and had to save his hfe
by a hasty retreat to the camp of Q. Metellus, who was acting
for Sulla against the Marians. He returned to Larinum
invested with the authority of Sulla to punish those towns-
people who had taken what was now the vanquished side :
and proscribed and put to death his enemies, among them
A. Aurius Mehnus, husband of Sassia.

§ 4. He now began to think once more of marriage : nor

&apos; Cp. Genealogical Table B.

INTRODUCTION. xxiii

was it long before he found a lady whose &apos; fine sympathies
and resolute spirit &apos; (humanitas constantiaque, § 26), as well
as her not inconsiderable fortune, singularly attracted him.
Sassia did not reject the advances of her husband&apos;s murderer :
she merely expressed some reluctance to undertake the
responsibihties of a stepmother : an obstacle which Oppianicus
succeeded in overcoming by the speedy removal of two of
the obnoxious children. A third, however, his son by Magia,
hved to evince his gratitude to his father for his life by taking
up his cause against Cluentius in this prosecution.

The category of Oppianicus&apos; crimes thus far committed is
not complete without the mention of the murder of his
brother C. Oppianicus, and his brother&apos;s wife, then in her preg-
nancy, as also the murder of Asuvius of Larinum. The motive
of these crimes also was lust for gain. The last mentioned
nearly brought him into serious trouble : he was actually
seized and brought before the tribunal of Q. ManHus,
triumvir capitalis at Rome, but escaped by bribing him to
discharge him. We cannot at this point abstain from an
expression of surprise that Oppianicus had not been brought to
justice before this for some of his previous crimes. If Cicero
is not (as his words in § 10 might seem to imply) blackening
the character of the dead in order the more easily to white-
wash the hving, we can only suppose that in the genferal disorder
of the period of the Social War and Sulla&apos;s proscriptions the
irregularities of Oppianicus had been overlooked. But some
of them belong to an earlier period.

§ 5. A. Cluentius Habitus, the present defendant, is now
brought into direct colHsion with his stepfather Oppianicus,
by no fault of his own, if we are to believe Cicero, vvho now
proceeds to the &apos;probabile ex causa,&apos; or argument based on
the probable motives which Oppianicus may have had for
wishing to murder his stepson. One of these is the insatiate
avarice of Oppianicus, who hoped through his mother Sassia
to become the possessor of his property. Another is the
personal dislike which he felt towards him, because he had
asserted, in opposition to himself, the rights of the muni-
cipality of Larinum in the matter of the college of Martiales,
denying that they were free Roman citizens.

These suggested motives seem inadequate, the latter
particularly. But the former also presupposes a good deal.
First, an intention of murdering Sassia. One murder more
or less may have been nothing to Oppianicus. But when

xxiv TNTRODUCTION.

Sassia was gone, her daughters remained, and she was likely
to have provided for them in her will.

§ 6. The plot of Oppianicus to remove his stepson by
poison speedily ensues. It was to be carried out by the
instrumentaHty of a low knave named C. Fabricius, through
whom overtures were made to Diogenes, the slave of
Cleophantus, a physician who was then in constant attend-
ance on Cluentius. The slave prudently Hstened to him, and
then went straight to his master, who informed Cluentius.
By the advice of his friend M. Baebius, a senator, Cluentius
bought the slave from Cleophantus. (Another witness to
the truth of these facts was P. QuinctiHus Varus, a man of
unimpeachable character, who had heard them at the time
from Cleophantus, § 53.) Then a trap was laid; a secret
interview was arranged between Scamander, a freedman of
Fabricius, and Diogenes : eye-witnesses concealed themselves
to watch it, and surprised Scamander with the poison and
the price for it both in his hands.^

This story as told by Cicero can scarcely be said to go on
aU-fours. Why was Diogenes sehing the drug to Scamander,
instead of taking it to administer himself ? This looks as if
the whole thing was got up by the friends of Cluentius to
ruin Oppianicus, whom he had every reason to hate. Besides,
the attempt to poison is discovered at a very early and imperfect
stage : it depends on the sole evidence of Diogenes, who was
at the time of the trial actuaUy a slave of Cluentius : why
bought by him it is not at first easy to say. Those who
disbeHeve this whole narrative reply, Because a slave could
not give evidence against his own master. On the other
hand, we may find sufficient reason in the foHovving con-
siderations : the enemies of CHientius would gain courage,
seeing that now they had his o%v7i slave to deal with ; they
would be tempted on to their own ruin. Cluentius, too,
might without suspicion confer directly with his own slave.
And for the substantial truth of his story, Cicero can appeal
to the evidence of respectable men : would M. Baebius have
lent himself to a vile plot for tlie ruin of Oppianicus?
Lastly, there is the fact that the almost unanimous verdicts
of two Roraan juries ratified this story.

§ 7- Cluentius proceeded, before attacking the prime mover
of this attempt on his Hfe, to impeach two subordinates in

the plot, Scamander and Fabrrcius. The first named vvas
defended by Cicero himself, who professes to have been out-
matched at all points by the other counsel, P. Cannutius : by
the side of the accused sat Oppianicus himself, who identified
himself completely with his case. The only vote recorded
for Scamander was that of the notorious Aelius Staienus. This
then was the first praeiudicium or &apos; previous decision &apos; against
Oppianicus. Fabricius, who was next accused, was fain to
betake himself for his defence to the brothers Caepasii. His
cause, desperate enough already, was made even worse by
his advocate : he was unanimously convicted. This was the
second praeiudiciuin.

Lastly, Cluentius impeached Oppianicus himself, before the
same jurors and presiding judge (C. Junius) as those who had
tried Scamander and Fabricius.^ We now enter upon the
history of the famous &apos;iudicium lunianum,&apos; which supplied
L. Quinctius and other agitators with a popular cry against
the senatorial juries, until these gave place, in b.c. 70, to
those constituted under the lex Aurelia.

§ 8. According to Cicero, Oppianicus, knowing the hope-
lessness of his position, had recourse once more to Staienus,
who had already sold him his vote at the trial of Scamander.
To him he handed a sum of 640,000 sesterces (^5440), which
was to be distributed among sixteen menihers of the bench,
whose votes, together with his own, would makeup the necessary
majority for acquittal. Staienus, when he had once got the
money, found himself very loath to part with it : a Httle
reflection convinced him that it would be unnecessary to do so
if he could procure the condemnation of Oppianicus. This
he set himself to do. By promising a bribe from the accused
to Bulbus, Gutta, and other jurors, and then disappointing
them on the pretence that Oppianicus had played him false,
he made it certain that they would all follow his example and
vote to a man for a conviction : in this event he had good
hopes that there would be no one to reclaim the money.

As to the latter of Staienus&apos; expectations, it was frustrated
in the same way as the poisoning plot in which Scamander
was employed : again there was a private interview, and
&apos; viri boni &apos; secreted behind the arras. By the help of their
evidence Staienus was forced to disgorge (§ 78). But the
conviction had followed in due course. Cannutius, tlie

^ §§ 55. 56, 59.
c

xxvi INTRODUCTION.

counsel for Cluentius, got vvind of bribery, and, thinking to
steal a march upon the other side, exercised what seems to
have been the right of the prosecution, and called for the
close of the pleadings. It is a significant fact that Staienus was
not in court at the time. The tribune L. Quinctius, advocate
of Oppianicus, used his official power to bring him up to vote.
By Oppianicus&apos; choice the voting was open. What was his
dismay when Staienus, Bulbus, Gutta, on whom the lot
happened to fall first, voted Guilty ! Many of the other
jurors, unable to conceive that this worthy trio could vote
otherwise than as they were paid to vote, supposed that
Cluentius had bribed, and therefore voted Not Proven,
preferring to reserve judgment before condemning one who,
however guilty, might not have had fair play in his trial. Of
the remainder, the rest of the corrupt seventeen took their
cue from Staienus and convicted : five only voted Not
Guilty.

§ 9. There is some difiiculty in determining the exact pro-
portions which made up this vote, the result of which was that
Oppianicus was condemned by a narrow majority. In the pro
Caec. § 29, Cicero says of this verdict, and of the conduct of
Fidiculanius Falcula, one of the jurors in particular : &apos;In eum
quid dicam nisi id, quod negare non possit, venisse in con-
siiium pubhcae quaestionis, cum eius consihi iudex non esset,
et in eo consiHo, cum causam non audisset et potestas esset
amphandi, dixisse sibi liquere ; cum de incognita re iudicare
voluisset, maluisse condemnare quam absolvere : cum, si
uno minus damnaret, condenifiari reus non posset., non ad
cognoscendam causam, sed ad explendam damnationem
praesto fuisse?&apos; That is, a single vote turned the scale
against Oppianicus, and that vote was Falcula&apos;s. Thirty-
two jurors had to vote (§ 74) : the passage quoted imports
that the division was 17 to 15; an even division (16 to 16)
would have been held a verdict, if not for the defendant, at
least in his favour. An adjournment would have ensued.
(Cp. the words of § 74.)

Prof. Ramsay says — The vote stood as follows : nitie jurors
of unimpeachable character gave a verdict of Guilty (here
follow the names, which occur in § 107, P. Octavius Balbus,
etc). Eight jurors, suspected of being venal, also gave a
verdict of GuiUy, viz., Staienus, Bulbus, Gutta, P. Popihus,
Fidiculanius Falcula, Aquihus, Septimius Scaevola, Egnatius.
They^V^ who said Not GuiUy, and the remaining ten who said

INTRODUCTION. xxvii

Not Proven, are not named in this speech.^ — This gives
17 against, 15 for, which is the right division. But when
we come to examine § 107, we shall find reason to pro-
pound the opinion that the names there given are those
of persons who voted Not Proven. This would give 18
against, 14 for:^ which cannot be reconciled with the state-
ment in the/r^ Caecina. We can only suppose that in § 107
Cicero does not give all the names of those who voted Not
Proven, who were ten in all, not nine.^ This will make the
division 17 to 15.

§ 10. Such however is the version which the orator gives to
the facts of the iudicium lunianum, in reply to the assertion
of the opposite side, that the seventeen jurors aforesaid were
bribed by Cluentius. We cannot but admire the genius,
which out of such sorry materials could create such a master-
piece of fancy ; nowhere has Cicero shown more insight into
the springs of human action, or drawn more hfeUke portraits,
than in his description of the worthy trio, Staienus, Bulbus,
and Gutta. Of course this ingenious narrative must suffer
from a closer scrutiny. It will be well to invite the student&apos;s
attention to some points in it.

It is prefaced by a glaring fallacy, that of § 64 : if there
was bribery, it is argued, it must have been employed either
by Cluentius or Oppianicus : the third alternative, that it
was employed by both, being quietly ignored. It is also
assumed as self-evident that the conviction of Oppianicus
must follow when the conviction successively of Scamander
and Fabricius had preceded, the jurors being bound by these
praeiudicia, which were of their own making. This again is

^ V. his Introd. p. 18, note.

2 i.e. 9vote N. L. : 5 Not Guilty : 8 vote Guilty : 10 remain, who must
also have voted Guilty. V. n. on § 106.

&apos; This seems better than to suppose (with Peterson) that Cicero is quoting
a certain number of names from the list both of thbse who voted N. L.
and those who voted C. The tone of the passage precludes us from
supposing that the names are not those of persons in the same category.

Zumpt (ii. 2. 128) suggests that for a decisive verdict it may have been
essential that the number of N. L. voters should be no more than one-
third of the whole number : in this instance less than 1 1 out of 32. (This
is a mere conjecture, on the analogy of a provision in the lex Acilia.)
Thus 10 vote N. L., 5 Not Guilty : the other 17 vote Guilty. (This is
Niemey r&apos;sview, Progr. Kiel, 1871.)

Kiotz [Inhalt, p. 219, in Sd/nmtl. Reden Cic.) says that 32 jurors, with
the exccption of five, found Opp. guilty. Probably he mistook the sense
of § 106, condemnare . . . paulo posterius maluerunt, where v. n.

not demonstratively proved : at any rate five jurors, whom
Cicero does not venture to accuse of corruption, did not recog-
nise the obligation of those previous verdicts (§ 76). And if
the N. L. voters were so convinced of the guilt of Oppianicus
as Cicero would have us suppose, it is scarcely hkely that the
mere suspicion that some of their less worthy colleagues were
about to vote the right way from wrong motives would have de-
termined them to suspend their vote of Guilty. Altogether the
want of precise statement as to the composition of the vote
which condemned Oppianicus is unsatisfactory : there is not a
hint (in this speech) of the narrowness of the majority by
which he was found guilty.^ Again it is the knaves who give
the right verdict, the honest men who withhold it or give the
wrong verdict, if Cicero is to be beUeved. Staienus&apos;s behaviour
is also an enigma. How could he have staked his &apos; spes
maiorum praemiorum &apos; (§ 74) on the precarious (or, as the
event showed, hopeless) chance of embezzhng the 640,000
sesterces in case Oppianicus vvas condemned ? Had not Op-
pianicus powerful friends, such as Quinctius, to act in his behalf
in that contingency ? It cannot of course be questioned that
money passed from Oppianicus to Staienus, since it was a no-
torious fact that after the trial the former recovered it, though,
be it observed, we do not read that he recovered precisely
640,000 sesterces (§ 78). But we are free to conjecture that
money did also pass from Cluentius to Staienus ; in fact that
the former outbid Oppianicus, and that the latter therefore left
him in the lurch for something more substantial than the
chance of embezzHng the deposit. This may help to explain
his absence from court when Cannutius called for the verdict.
The prosecution were confident of a majority without him
(having secured, as we shall see, Fidiculanius Falcula) ; the
defence could not spare him. He himself naturally arranged
to be absent from court, knowing what Cannutius meant to
do, and not wishing to create a sensation by his vote, or. to
lose the sesterces of Oppianicus. But Quinctius, acting for
Oppianicus, forced him to return. On this theory the conduct

1 Zumpt indeed sees an argument in this for the view that Cluentius
bribed. Leaving the N. L. voters out of account (who could not be
reckoned upon), 16 votes were enough to ensure acquittal (§ 74). But
17, we know from Cic. , laid themselves open to corrupt offers. And we
have proved that 17 did actually convict. The inference is obvious to us,
and Z. thinks ii would have been obvious to the jury, if Cic. had supplied
them with the second premiss (Z. Criminalr. ii. 2, pp. 128. 129).

INTRODUCTION. xxix

of Staienus and his confederates accords with the conduct of
Verres, whom Cicero himself accuses of having similarly
accepted bribes from both parties, favoured the higher bidder,
and refused to return the money of the other.^

§ II. To return to the narrative. The penalty was out-
lawry {aquae et ignis inferdictio), the heaviest which was
generally inflicted upon a Roman citizen in repubUcan times,
involving as it did the practical loss of caput. Cicero&apos;s elo-
quence revels in the description of the forlorn and wandering
life of one who was civilly, though no longer in a reUgious
sense, under a ban. But the miseries of this banishment
were not without their alleviation ; it was passed not in the
bleak solitude of some Tomi, but in the fairest district of
Italy ; the exile might at times find a welcome at the villa of
an old friend such as Quinctius, and he even rented some
sort of lodging at the very gates of Rome. Sassia, too, did
not altogether desert him, though she is accused of unfaithful-
ness to her husband, who heard of it through a trusty slave
called Nicostratus. About two years after his trial Oppianicus
died at his suburban lodging, of injuries sustained by a fall from
his horse, or, as Sassia professed to believe, and as the pro-
secutor alleged, of poison administered to him in bread by
one M. AseUius, at the instance of Cluentius. At the same
time it is worthy of remark that he had been for a long time in
failing health.

This was in the year b.c. 72. The friends of Oppianicus at
Rome had not meanwhile been idle, especially as poUtical
feeling reinforced personal considerations. A series of pro-
secutions was instituted against the guilty, or presumably
guilty, jurors and judge, and Cluentius himself became the
object of intense popular disUke {invidia).

§ 12. It is not necessary to enter very minutely into these
prosecutions, most of which ended in convictions, urged in
the present trial by the prosecution as so many recorded
verdicts against Cluentius (§ 88).

mus aut vidimus, qui cum reo transigat, post cum accusatore decidat ?

XXX INTRODUCTION.

First came the condemnation of C. Junius, the iudex
qiiaesiionis} who had presided at the trial, and with whose
name it was henceforth associated quite as often as with that
of the accused.2 The impeachment preferred by Quinctius
was based on technical grounds, mainly in connection with
the subsortitio or supplementary appointment of Fidiculanius
Falcula, which Junius was suspected to have made in the
interests of Cluentius. Here it suits the convenience of Cicero
to call the charges &apos; frivolous and trumpery &apos;; he had expressed
a different opinion on another occasion.^

Closely connected with this trial were those of C. Fidicula-
nius Falcula himself, who was accused in the first instance of
informahty in acting as a juror in a case in which the decury
to which he belonged was not competent to act. He was
acquitted on this charge, but soon afterwards directly accused
of having received a bribe from Cluentius, and found not
guilty. Cicero does well to make much of this verdict ; it is
a strong testimony for Ckientius. Yet in the pro Caec,
dehvered only three years before the present speech, the
orator accepts the popular opinion that Falcula gave the
decisive vote, and that he had got 50,000 sesterces for it ;
that is, Cluentius had outbid Oppianicus, who gave 40,000, by
10,000 sesterces.^

The other verdicts were adverse to Ckientius, even if only
indirectly so. Bulbus was found guilty of 7jiaiestas; Popihus
oi arnbitus; Gutta of the same; Staienus oimaiestas; Scaevola
of repetundae. In all these cases their alleged misconduct in
the trial of Oppianicus told against the defendants ; in the last
named^ it was taken into account in the litis aestiniatio, or
assessment of damages which foUowed the verdict.

% 13. There were also other &apos; decisions,&apos; as the prosecution
called them, though Cicero disputes the propriety of the term.

Nam cum dixisset minus Idod, popukis cum risu acclamavit ipsa esse.
Meminerant enim omnes, quantum in Albiano iudicio accepisset. &apos; When
he said &apos; less than 50,&apos; the people cried that it was just his figure ; fifty
thousand was the bribe he took in the famous trial. (The rest of the
passage should be read. )

INTRODUCTION. xxxi

The censors had stigmatised several of. these persons on the
ground of their comphcity in this pubhc scandal : Popihus,
although in his case that perfect accord in the action of the
tvvo censors, which was essential to its value in the argument,
was wanting ^ ; Gutta and M. Aquihus ; and lastly Cluentius
himself.

Then again one Cn. Egnatius had disinherited his son for
the part he had taken in the same trial. Also, a resolution
of the senate was to be found among the records of that
assembly, cahing for the appointment of a special commission
to deal with those who were responsible for this miscarriage of
justice; but nothing came of it. The orator can therefore
fairly urge that the misconduct of his chent, which had been
discussed for years in the heated atmosphere of pohtical
meetings, had only once been the express subject of a judicial
inquiry, and on that occasion the verdict had been favourable
to Cluentius.

§ 14. We pass next to the brief narrative of the deaths of
Vibius Cappadox and Balbutius, the latter of which was said
to have taken place at the wedding-breakfast of Oppianicus the
younger. Accius had adduced certain instances of violent
conduct and rapacity, said to have been exhibited by Cluentius
at various times ; this was the probabile ex vita, which was to
prepare the minds of his hearers for the charges which he
hoped to prove. Cicero makes short work of both. He is
evidently no longer on thin ice ; he can afford to be some-
Avhat careless in the reply which he vouchsafes. &apos; What has
Habitus ever done &apos; — thus he dehberately begs the question —
&apos; to make you think him capable of such a deed ? &apos; The fact
is, &apos;res se ipsa defendit.&apos;

§ 15. But the immediate occasion of the present trial was,
if we are to beheve Cicero, the persistent animosity of Sassia
towards her son Cluentius, and her conviction, or at any rate
affirmation, that he had poisoned her husband.

This charge was supported, it would seem, by more serious
arguments than the other charges of poisoning, but ahhough
treated by Cicero at greater length, is scarcely treated more
seriously. These facts, as he narrates them, bring the plot of
the speech (if we may be ailowed the expression) to its ghastly
denouement — the unnatural mother bringing her son to trial
for his hfe.

^ V. § 132, note.

xxxii INTRODUCTION.

§ l6. Immediately after her husband&apos;s death Sassia de-
termined to institute an inquiry into its causes. To this end
she purchased Strato, a slave of A. RupiUus, her late husband&apos;s
physician, and examined him by torture, together with Ascla,
one of her own slaves, and the faithful Nicostratus, whom she
had forced her stepson Oppianicus the younger to give up to
her. The examination was held in the presence of a council of
respectable men, friends of Oppianicus, but in spite of the
cruel severity employed, her object, which was to get evidence
against her son Cluentius, was not attained. A fresh and
even more cruel inquiry was held ; nothing was extorted from
the loyal slaves, and Sassia was compelled by the witnesses
to desist from further cruelties. Nicostratus was restored to
his master ; Strato was taken into favour by his new mistress,
and estabhshed at Larinum as a medical practitioner. Three
years passed in inaction ; her maUce was only dormant.
Towards the end of that time she married her stepson to her
daughter by A. Aurius Mehnus, wishing by this connection,
and the hopes of a succession which it involved, to acquire a
complete hold upon him. This step was well-timed ; the
services of young Oppianicus were speedily to be called into
requisition. Our attention is invited to a story of crime taken
from the annals of slave-Hfe, but not at all more hideous than
the misdeeds of the high-born and the free which occupy the
main part of the speech. Strato stole some money from a
chest, murdered two of his fellow-slaves, and threw their
bodies into the fish-pond. By an accidental discovery the
guilt was brought home to the offender ; a boy who was in
the secret told the truth to his mistress. She seized this
excuse to put Strato, and with him Nicostratus, once more
upon the rack. This time no respectable witness was present.
The depositions thus extorted were taken down, and now, at
the trial of Cluentius, Sassia produces them in evidence
against him. But Cicero refuses to recognise them, for they
contain not a word about the theft and murders of Strato,
which were certainly the main subject of inquiry; they are
not properly attested; and of the deponents, Nicostratus is
not forthcoming, Strato was forthwith crucified, having had his
tongue cut out.

§ 17. The narrative closes with a vivid description of the
preparations for the trial ; there is Sassia, on the one hand,
journeying to the capital from the distant shores of the
Adriatic, with her ample retinue and stores of wealth, yet

INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

avoided and abhorred by all she met ; on the other hand
there are the deputies of Larinum, Teanum, Luceria, Bovia-
num, and all the country-side, flocking to Rome to testify
their esteem and love for their persecuted countryman. So
general has the exodus been that the defence of Larinum is
at present committed to the women and children !

§ l8. Few will seriously doubt that Cicero has satisfactorily
disposed of the charges of poisoning. There are flaws in his
reasoning, which probably no one knew better than he himself
did. Thus the argument that the poison must have been
administered in a liquid and not in bread is worthless. And
the orator gives his own version of the story of Oppianicus&apos;
death with some hesitation {de equo cecidisse dicitur, § 175), and
without vouchsafing evidence. But then it was only incum-
bent on him to prove the negative of the version given by the
prosecution. Again, with regard to the depositions of the
slaves, it is quite as Ukely that he should have refrained from
stating the contents of these, because he was unwilHng to
weary his auditors, as because he intended to conceal facts.
In fact, unless we are to accept Dr. Bardfs hypothesis, that
this speech was a defiberate, and, as it proved, a successful
attempt to draw a red herring across the trail, it is idle to
imagine that the case of the prosecution, with regard to the
charges of poisoning, was any stronger than Cicero represents
it to have been. Of Chientius&apos; acquittal there can be little or
no doubt, in view of the boast which is attributed to his advo-
cate by Quintilian — se tenebras offudisse iudicibus in causa
Cluenti.

IV. On the occasional Colloquialism of Cicero&apos;s style.

So much has been said about the place of Cicero in the
history of Roman literature, and his services to Latin prose,
as sponsor for much of its vocabulary, and perfecter, if not
creator, of the &apos; period &apos; after the best models of Greek prose
writing, that nowadays it is scarcely possible for labourers in
the same field of inquiry to add anything substantial to what
is already known. Leaving therefore the larger portions of
the subject on one side, we propose to call attention to a single
element in the composition of this rich and diversified style,
hitherto perhaps insufficiently noticed. Our examples will
necessarily be taken mainly from the Cluentiana : a larger
induction might yield a more conclusive result.

xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

To say that Cicero is sometimes coUoquial is not to accuse
him of provinciaHsm, of anything such as the &apos;Patavinity&apos;
must have been which the ancients found in Livy. Corni-
ficius 1 defines * Latinitas &apos; as that &apos; quae sermonem purum
conservat ab omni vitio remotum &apos; : and such faults he classifies
as &apos;solecism and barbarism.&apos; The educated society of Rome
were doubtless incapable of either. Their speech, though
conversational, was good Latin still : it was not the &apos; sermo
plebeius &apos; of the Subura. We may judge this from the pure
and correct Latinity of Cicero&apos;s correspondents ; it may be
much inferior to his in brilhancy and dehcacy, but in other
respects the inferiority is shght. Doubtless the orator him-
self fixed a high standard of pure Latin for the society in
which he moved, nevertheless we ought not absolutely to deny
that his contemporaries exerted any reflex action upon him.

Thus we are merely asserting that there are certain con-
versational words, phrases, constructions, which, while they are
perfectly good Latin, might by a purist be considered inappro-
priate in elevated and serious writing, and that Cicero does
not scruple sometimes to adopt these in his oratoricai style.

Professor Tyrrell has pointed out^ that there are frequent
correspondences between the language of famihar letter-
vvriting and that of famifiar dialogue. There are also occa-
sional correspondences between the languages of both and
the language of pubhc speeches.

We may classify our examples under three heads : {a) fresh
meanings of words ; {b) special forms and uses of words ;
{c) constructions and turns of expression.

{a) Fresh meanings —

(i) Postido, ajiow, &apos; to expect&apos;: § 66 of this speech,
cupidiore quam fides iudicis postulabat. Cp. Planc.
§ 57. Common in Comic poets : Pl. Tr. 237, nunquam
amor quemquam nisi cupidum hominem | postulat
se in plagas conicere.

(2) Indignum esse faci?ius., § 145 note, &apos;a monstrous

thing^ : Plautus only : Cic. has it also, ad Att. ii. 13.

(3) exclusus, &apos; shunned,&apos; § 175 note. Also in Hor.

Sertn. ii. 3. 260, am.ator | exclusus qui distat.

(4) Possibly the ironical credo, so common in Cic. Cp.

(5) Sic hominem accipiemiis^ § 163, &apos;treat&apos; : v. L. and Sh.

accipio (i. c. a) : thus used, with adverbs in Comic
poets and LuciHus, e.g. Pl. Aul. 622.

(6) Adfinis with dat. &apos;a party to,&apos; § 127 note : Com.

poets. Liv. has a. noxae once.

(7) Nulliis esse, probably : § 77 note : &apos;to be obUterated.&apos;

(8) The legal phrases elogiutn, iogus, and dica are used

only by the Lawyers, Com. poets, and Cic.

We may add to these Cicero^s partiaUty for diminutives,
and that not only in the Letters. V. Index for exx.

(b) Special forms and uses of words : —

(i) Fortassis for fortasse, § 144 crit. note.

(2) Senati^ gen. case, div. in Caec. § 19 (Kays.). Cp.

victi, Capt. 849, sumpti, &apos;Tr. 250, etc.

(3) Miltiadi^ etc, from Greek nouns ending in -7^s : accord-

ing to Madv. de Fin. i. § 14, the only form of such
genitives in Cic. So Philocrati, etc, in Plaut.

(4) Use of comparative and superlative degree of parti-

cipial adjectives : such as notior, notissi??ius, appara-
tissi?nus, accomniodatior, -issimus, exploratior and
accuratissimus {\n Epp. ad Att.). Com. poets have
factius, occlusior, ecfertissimus, and many others.
Other writers have scarcely any, except auctior,
emendatior, accuratior.

(5) Amplexo, § 124 crit. n. Such forms are a relic of the

older language, surviving mainly in popular speech.

(6) Inermus, § 25 crit. n. : a similar survival.

(7) Nostrorimi, probably : gen. plur. ; § 194 crit. n.

(8) Quicquid, ior quicque-. § 52 notes.

(9) Nihil quicquam, a strong nihil. Common in Com.

poets ; occurs even in Cic de Orat. i. § 134.

{c) CoNSTRUCTiONS. Thcse are mostly explained in the
notes too fully to require more than a mention here : —

(i) The imperf. and pluperf subj. jussive : as restitisses,

&apos; you ought to have resisted.&apos;
(2) The rare gerund-construction of Fhil. v. § 6, facuUas

% 60. Found only in Plaut., Ter., Lucr., Varr., the

archaistic Gellius, and Fronto, besides Cic

(3) The omission of the pronoun subject before the in-

finitive after verbs of saying and thinking : Pl. Capt.
253, cum cavisse ratus est.

(4) Faciuin esse oportuit^ factum oportuit, ^129 note.

(5) The frequent use of cum with indic. in past time.

§ 2,^ note.

(6) The use of pronorainal subject with the infm. after

volo: Pl. Merc. 150, vin tu te mi esse obsequentem
an nevis ? : and frequently in Plaut. So Catil. iii.
§ 25, non ilU hanc urbem conflagrare sed se in hac
urbe florere voluerant. So § 152 of this speech,
note. Compare ex. from Pl. Tr. quoted above
{a, i).

(7) /&lt;:?/^^/ impersonal : § 154, quoniam id non posset ; an

eUipse of fieri ought perhaps to be supposed, in
Com. poets and Cic. alike.

(8) Lucrifacere, &apos; to count as gain,&apos; Cic. Verr. ii. 3. 116:

this and similar genitives (compendi, praemii) are
common in Latin dialogue.

(10) The use oi ni =^ si 7ton : § 10 note.

(11) Facio with dat. or abl. of person, &apos; to do something

with &apos; : ahnost confined to Cic. and Com. poets.
But again we find the same use in Hor. Serm. i. i. 63,
quid facias illi ? Cp. notes on §§ 53, 186.

(12) Quia instead of quod after verbs of the affections

(doleo gaudeo suscenseo) is common in Plaut, e.g.
lacrimas mi haec eliciunt, quia . . ., Tr. 290. Cic. has
it sometimes: Sull. § 50, reprehendis me quia defen-
dam. In late Lat. quia came to be used after verbs
of saying and thinking, in place of the infin. (Lact. 4.
12. 18, scis quia ego sum dominus Deus).

(13) The use of cum with indic. after laudo and gratulor :

Mil. § 99 ; ad Fam. xiii. 24, gratias ago cum tantum
litterae meae potuerunt. V. Madv. de Fin. i. § 1 o for
parallel exx. from Com. poets. It is an older con-
struction than that of quod, commonly used.

(14) Nihil tam remotum ab accusatione quam Cluentius,

§ 42 : V. note.
These examples will illustrate the principle which it is
sought to estabhsh. Something must of course be discounted
for Cicero&apos;s intimate acquaintance with the earUer Uterature of
his country, especiaUy with the Comedians. When we find
an identity of expression, such as that between &apos;in pauca

INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

confer&apos; (Pl. Poen. 1222) and &apos;ut in pauca conferam&apos; i^Caec,
§ 17), we shall be inclined to account it a case of more or
less conscious borrowing on the part of the later writer. But
in numerous instances this will not apply ; and we shall pre-
fer to beheve that Cicero, purist as he was, was far removed
from pedantry and conventionalism. The occasional col-
loquialism of his diction is due not to a careless habit of
composition, but to the sincerity and Hving energy of his
style. Unhke the rhetoricians of a later day, he was in touch
with the people : their speech at its best was his.

(a) Dinaea, a rich old lady of Larinum, survived three of her children,
Num. Aurius, Magia, Cn. Magius. Already a heavy blow had fallen on
her, — the disappearance of her son M. v\urius in the Social War. News
came to her that he was alive just before her fatal illness : and she left
400,000 sesterces by will to him, but the bulk of the property to young
Oppianicus (§§ 21, 22). This illness is attributed, in § 40, to poison ad-
ministered by L. Clodius, a quack doctor introduced to her by Oppianicus.
She died about the time of SuIIa&apos;s victory, b.c. 82.

(/3) Taken prisoner in the Social War at Asculum, enslaved, and thus
for years lost to his family. At last news came that he was in the hands
of Q. Sergius, a senator. This was just before his mother&apos;s death. Friends
proceeded to the Ager Gallicus to ransom him. Oppianicus used bribery
to delay the accomplishment of their purpose. Finally he had M. Aurius
assassinated, doing all this that the whole property of Dinaea might pass
to his own son, §§ 21, 23, 24 : &apos; avunculum filii sui,&apos; § 125.

(7) Died after the disappearance of M. Aurius, for he made his half-
brother Cn. Magius his heir.

(5) Died third of the family, leaving his property to be divided between
Dinaea and Oppianicus the younger, son of his sister Magia (§ 21), But
we read in §§ 33, 34, that he left his wife, who was expectiag her confine-
ment, a legacy payable through a posthumous son and heir, if such were
born. This precaution against the intrigues of Oppianicus was unavailing,
§§ 34» 35- The reversionary heir, Oppianicus minor, got the whole
property eventually.

When Cn. Magius was making his will, he showed some suspicion of
Oppianicus (§ 34) : that is all that is alleged against him with regard to
the family of Dinaea up to the time of her death.

VI. The Crimes of Oppianicus

are rapidly enumerated in § 125. A list of them here may
be useful.

1. He poisoned his first wife Cluentia, § 30.

2. He poisoned Auria, wife of his brother C. Oppianicus,
while she was pregnant : a double murder, § 31.

3. He poisoned his brother C. Oppianicus : by this and
the prevtous crime securing his inheritance for himself, § 31.

4. He induced Papia, the widow of his brother-in-law Cn.
Magius, to procure abortion after her husband&apos;s death, married
her, and thus secured his inheritance, §§ 34, 35.

5. He poisoned his mother-in-law Dinaea, and through his
son Oppianicus gained possession of her property, after
tampering with her will, §§ 22, 40, 41.

6. He had M. Aurius, her son, his brother-in-law, raur-
dered, in order that he might gain the whole property of
Dinaea, § 23.

7. He had A. Aurius, a kinsman of the Aurii (sons of
Dinaea), A. Aurius Mehnus, L. Aurius son of the latter, and

INTRODUCTION. xli

one Sex. Vibius, prosciibed and put to death at Larinum.
This was because he was threatened with proceedings on
account of the last-mentioned murder, § 25.

8. He murdered two of his sons, by Papia and Novia re-
spectively, because Sassia refused to become the stepmother
to three children.

9. At some time before this he instigated one of his
creatures, a certain Avillius, to murder a rich and dissolute
young man, Asuvius of Larinum, having previously forged
his will. He was arrested by Manlius, the triumvir, and only
escaped by bribing this worthless magistrate to abandon the
case.

10. The council of Larinum declared him guilty of falsi-
fying the municipal records, § 41.

11. Lastly, he made an attempt on the life of Cluentius, for
which he was ultimately brought to justice, and convicted of
an attempt to poison.

Vn. The Wives of Oppianicus.

Oppianicus was married at least five times. There is no
single statement in the speech either as to the number of his
wives, or as to the order of their succession. But the following
list is pretty certainly correct : —

1. Cluentia, sister of Cluentius the elder; she takes
preccdence of the rest, as belonging to an earlier generation.

2. Magia, daughter of Dinaea, by whom he had a son,
Oppianicus the younger.

3. Papia, who was living at Teanum Apulum, evidently
divorced from her husband, with her young son, whom Op-
pianicus sent for and murdered just before his marriage with
Sassia (§§ 27, 28). She is to be identified with the widow of
Cn. Magius, who had lent herself to his evil purposes and
married him, &apos;quae nuptiae non diuturnae fuerunt : erantenim
non matrimonii dignitate, sed sceleris societate coniunctae,&apos;
§ 35) — words which suggest divorce rather than decease.

4. Novia, whose infant son Oppianicus murdered within
ten days of the murder of his son by Papia. We may suppose
that if Novia had then been alive, but divorced, Cic. would
have enlarged upon her maternal grief.

5. Sassia, widow of A. Aurius Melinus and of A. Cluentius
Habitus the elder.

d

xlii INTRODUCTION.

A sixth wife car&gt; be supposed, if we distinguish the unnamed
widow of Cn. Magius from Papia, as Prof. Ramsay does.
The story seems sensational enough without this. Others
have identified the widow of Magius with Novia.

If Papia is rightly identified thus, of course she follows
Magia (sister of Cn. Magius) in order of marriage. The
relative ages of their sons adapts itself to this view. In
B.c. 72 the younger Oppianicus, son of Magia, was still &apos;puer &apos;
(§ 176) when his father died : he married in b.c. 69: we
must thus suppose him to have been born about b.c. 90-87.
Papias son was a child at school when Oppianicus sent for
him in b.c. 82 : thus he was perhaps born at some time
within the years b.c. 85-87. There is room for one other
marriage and burial (or divorce) before the year b.c. 82,
that of Novia : but scarcely, one wouid think, for more than
that one. It is noteworthy that Cluentia is the only wife
whom Oppianicus is accused of having murdered : the plural
uxores in § 125 and elsewhere is rhetorical.

EXORDIUM.

(§ l) The speech for the prosecution was in two parts ; the
first resting on the prejudice about Oppianicus&apos; trial ;
the second deahng with the nature of charges of
poisoning.

(§ 2) I shall followthe same order, treating the second head
shortly, but the first, which is fitter for a &apos; contio &apos;
than a trial, at length. (§§ 3, 4) But I rely on you,
gentlemen ; as to the prejudice, I know you are men
of the world, and (§§ 5, 6) you will give me a fair
hearing.

8) It is hard to have lain under this prejudice eight
years, but a fair trial is a safeguard, and I hope it
will end here, if you will deal with it impartially.

II.
III.

IV,

(§§7,

I.

(§ 9) The source of all the prejudice is thc charge that
Ckientius bought a verdict of Guilty against Oppi-
anicus. I shall show {a) that his guilt was clear,
(d) that the jury was bound to convict, {c) that the
bribery took place on Oppianicus&apos; side, not Cluentius&apos;.

A. — Oppianicus&apos; Crimes.

(§ 10) What were Oppianicus&apos; crimes ? (§ ll) Cluentius
prosecuted not from a mere desire to figure as a pro-
secutor, but because he was driven to do so by in-
famous wrongs. I must be detailed.

Cluentius the elder died 88 b.c, leaving my client, then
fifteen years old, and a daughter, who shortly after
married A. Aurius Mclinus, her first cousin (§ 12).
But Sassia, her mother, became enamoured of Melinus
(§ 13)» ^^^ pursued him with her passion. The
daughter confided her trouble to Ckientius (§ 14).
Meknus suddenly divorced his wife and married
vSassia (§ 15).

ANALYSIS.

Ch. VI. There was a scandal which grieved Cluentius, but (§ i6)
he could only disown Sassia.

(§ 17) It grieves me that his defence should be an attack
on his mother ; but from this sprang a feud between
them, (§ 18) and she has been at the bottom of all
his troubles ever since, and is now maintaining this
prosecution. Silence about her is impossible.
VII. (§ 19) Let me take one by one the grounds of Oppianicus&apos;
conviction. First, Cluentius was driven to prosecute
(§ 20) by an attempt on his own life by poison. The
case was so clear that Oppianicus had need of Staienus^
help. (§§ 21, 22) Dinaea, whose daughter married
Oppianicus, and bore him the present prosecutor,
young Oppianicus, left a will, of which the latter was
heres : a son, who was then a slave in Gaul after the
Social War, was to have a legacy 0^400,000 sesterces,
VIII. should he be discovered. (§ 23) But Oppianicus, the

father, got M. Aurius put out of the way, and suborned
the person who had informed Dinaea of her son&apos;s
being still aHve, to conceal his whereabouts. (§ 24) A.
Aurius of the same family charging him with these
two crimes, he fled to Q. Metellus&apos; camp, and after-
wards (§ 25) returning in Sulla&apos;s time to Larinum,
made himself and three others municipes, and put to
death A. Aurius, Sassia&apos;s husband, Aurius Melinus, a
son of A. Aurius, and a tool of his own in his former
crime, Sex. Vibius.
IX. (§ 26) Next he fell in love with Sassia, and as her objec-
tion to him was that he had three sons, (§ 27) he
summoned home from a distance one by a divorced
wife, whereon the boy shortly died under suspicious
circumstances, and then (§ 28) he murdered the
second [the third, young Oppianicus, as Dinaea&apos;s
/ieres, was worth preserving] and married Sassia.

(§ 29) Judge by your own indignation now, what must
have been the feelings of the jury when he was tried.
Conviction was certain, and bribery needless.

(§ 30) But more : he murdered his wife Cluentia, my
client&apos;s aunt, Auria his brother Caius&apos; wife, at a
time when she was with child, and then his brother
himself.
^II. (§§ 33, 34) On his deathbed his brother-in-law, Cn.
Magius, had left money to the child of which his

wife then was pregnant, and a sum to her only in the
event of the child&apos;s birth. Mark his suspicions of
Oppianicus. But he was too short-sighted. Oppi-
anicus bribed her to procure abortion, and the whole
inheritance fell under the will to Oppianicus the
younger.

36) By the help of Avillius, a sharper, he decoyed
Asuvius, a rich youth of Larinum, to Rome, and had
him murdered at the Esquiline gate ; Avillius having
previously duly executed a will under Asuvius&apos; name.
(§ 38) AvilHus was taken before Q. Manlius, then
triumvir, and confessed all, but (§ 39) Oppianicus
when arrested bribed Manlius.

40) He then procured L. Clodius, a quack of Ancona,
to poison Dinaea and {§ 41) forged a will in her
name. He even tampered with the archives of
Larinum. He was universally hated, yet Chientius
would have left him unassailed, but (§ 42) after the
attempt on his own life he had no choice.

B.— Plot against Cluentius.

§ 43, 44) It happened thus : Oppianicus declaring certain
priests of Mars at Larinum to be Roman citizens, the
Larinates prevailed on Chientius to appear against
him for them at Rome. Hence he came into col-
lision with Oppianicus. Besides, he had made no
will, and Oppianicus designed to kill him, so that
Sassia should inherit his property, and thereafter to
kill Sassia. (§ 46) He had two friends, rogues of
Larinum, the Fabricii. {§ 47) Cleophantus, a doctor
then attending Chientius, had a slave Diogenes.
Oppianicus set C. Fabricius on to corrupt this slave.
He revealed it to his master, and after consuhation
with Cluentius and Baebius, a senator, atrap waslaid.
Chientius bought Diogenes, and poison was seized
in the hands of Scaniander, a freedman of Fabricius.

48) With guilt so plain, how can Oppianicus&apos; conviction
be called corrupt, or Cluentius be said to have prose-
cuted otherwise than perforce ? (§§ 49 and 50) Sca-
mander was tried first ; pressed by friends of Fabricius
from Alatrium, I undertook the defence, (§5i)amost
difficult task. {§§ 51-54) I did my best, but I had no
case. I could make no way, and throughout it was

as niuch Oppianicus&apos; guilt as Scamander&apos;s that was
at issue. (§ 55) ^^ Oppianicus&apos; advice, Scamander
asked that the jury might retire. On the first day&apos;s
pleading he was convicted by every vote but one,
and that one was Staienus&apos; own.
(§ 56) Next, Cluentius prosecuted Fabricius. (§ 57) The
brothers Caepasii defended and (§ 58) Cannutius pro-
secuted ; but the case was so bad that they seemed to
be playing into his hands. The jury laughed at them.

C— Oppianicus&apos; Trial.

The same jury tried Oppianicus ; how could they acquit
him and convict his tools ? (§ 62) The prosecution did
not need to bribe ; (§ 63) bribery there was ; but by him
who risked most, and was twice convicted already.
(§ 64) Either Cluentius or Oppianicus bribed, but
only one. That one was Oppianicus; (§ 65) beyond
doubt he employed Staienus. First on Scamander&apos;s
trial, when Staienus alone acquitted; (§ 67) on Fab-
ricius&apos; trial even he could not acquit. So on the next
trial stronger measures were needed.

(§ 68) Two years before, Staienus had taken money to
bribe jurors in Atella&apos;s case and embezzled it. Now,
being ready for more, he told Oppianicus (§ 69) that
he alone would manage the affair, and received ;!^50oo.

Then, seeing nothing could suit him better than to pocket
it, and let Oppianicus be condemned, being needy
and greedy, (§ 70) he made this plan. (§ 71) To the
unprincipled he promised bribes (the rest needed no
incensing), namely, to Bulbus and Gutta, and then,
saying Oppianicus had thrown them over, incensed
them against his employer.

(§ 73) Rumours of corruption were afloat, and Cannutius
decided to take a verdict before matters went further.
Oppianicus thought Staienus had bought the sixteen
votes needed. (§ 74) So suddenly did the case close
that Staienus chanced to be arguing elsewhere.
Cluentius and Cannutius did not object to his absence,
but Oppianicus and L. Quinctius, then Tr. Plebis,
did ; and the latter went out and fetched him in
to vote. (§ 75) Oppianicus called for public voting
so as to make his jurors earn their money. The
upright looked at the corrupt to see which way they

were bribed. Bulbus, Staienus, and Gutta convicted.
(§ 76) There was some hesitation among the jurors
owing to the rumoured corruption, but a conviction
was obtained, only five voting Not Guilty.
(§ 77) Quinctius made recent unpopular verdicts the text
for an agitation against the senate. (§ 78) Then
Staienus was compelled to confess and disgorge. Pre-
j udice was kindled. Men thought it was the conviction
that was bought ; (§ 79) they knew nothing of Oppi-
anicus, and were inflamed by Quinctius. C. Junius,
who presided, though on the verge of the praetorship,
was driven from public life. (§ 80) I am glad the
storm is a little blown over now, for then Ckientius
could not have got a hearing. (§ 8l) In fact he did
not bribe ; (§ 82) it has never been traced in his
books. It was Oppianicus who objected to Staienus&apos;
absence at the vote ; (§ 83) and then compare the
characters of the men. (§§ 84-86) It is suggested
that Oppianicus gave Staienus the money to appease
Chientius. But peace in the abandonment of the
prosecution, or Oppianicus&apos; safety, was impossible.
It was a lie of Staienus&apos;, invented at a time when any
lie was better than truth, and probably was prompted
by Cethegus. (§ 87) They suggest also it was to
bribe Chientius to betray the prosecution. But
why employ a juror and a man like Staienus ? The
sum 640,000 shows it was to bribe sixteen jurors with.

D. — Alleged other Convictions of Cluentius.

(§ 88) Further, it is said Cluentius&apos; bribery has often been
judicially derided. Absurd ; it never was tried be-
fore. These &apos; trials &apos; were storms, not trials ; some
make for Cluentius; some did not make against him ;
some never were dubbed trials before.

i.i/, C. Junius&apos; condemnation was due to passing pre-
judicej (§ 90) Quinctius indecently pressed it on.
And what he was fined for was irregularity in his
appointment, which was the fault of Verres ; (§ 92)
it does not touch Chientius, and was no fair trial.
(§ 94) How much better a precedent was Faustus
Sulla&apos;s case, which was postponed to secure a fair
hearing. (§ 95) Quinctius&apos; influence bore down
evcrything ; the power of that office, the cases of P.

Popilius and Q. Metellus, show : (§ 96) it was no trial,
but mere violence, and is not a judgment against
Cluentius.

(§ 97) id, Bulbus&apos; conviction. That was for ??iaiestas,
not for his conduct in Oppianicus&apos; case. Though
that was brought up against him there was plenty to
convict him for without it.

de a??ibitu.

(§ 99) d^th, Staienus : If his crime was not ??iaiestas
(§ 100) his defence was that he got the money for
Cluentius, and it was laughed out of court. He was
proved to live by bribery. (§ lOl) No ; the bribery
was brought home to Oppianicus, so Cluentius must
be innocent. (§ 103) Junius&apos; conviction was pro-
cured by violence, and the other cases make for us.

$th, Case of Falcula, who was a juror at the trial. He was
twice tried : ist, for informality in his appointment,
and acquitted ; (§ 104) but I waive that ; 2d, he
was tried de repetu?idis, and acquitted after a fair
trial.

(§§ 105-106) Now, though the votes of those who acquitted
Oppianicus, however inconsistent, are excusable,
(§ 107) we find among those who did iiot acquit,
Octavius Balbus, Considius, Pedo, Mergus, Bas-
ilus, Caudinus, Cassius, Heius, Saturius. Herein
iay the difference between Junius&apos; and Falcula&apos;s trial,
that in the former Quinctius prevented any defence :
and then on quitting office abandoned his agitation.

(§ 109) You remember him. It all grew out of his vexa-
tion at not getting Oppianicus off, as if having him
for an advocate was not most significant. (§§ lio
and II l) He never defended a case before, and
was a mere demagogue, an unbridled ambitious
roturier. (§ 113) Falcula&apos;s acquittal at any rate
demolishes the argument of the prosecution : for he,
if any man, was bribed ; he convicted ; he had not
sat out the case ; so that either those who rely on
these trials must impeach them or admit that
Oppianicus&apos; trial was a fair one ; (§ II4) but why
were the other jurors never put on their trial, and
why were those who were tried, not tried on this
charge directly ?

6//z, Scaevola&apos;s Litis Aestimatio (§ 1x5), it is said, indirectly
found as a fact that Oppianicus&apos; trial was corrupt.
But it is a very informal proceeding : a jury often
disregards its own Litis Aestimatio : and there were
plenty of other reasons for Scaevola&apos;s conviction. He
never was tried on this charge.

(§ 117) 7M, The authority of the Censors. That is no
iudicium at all. (§ I18) I say nothing against him,
but it is not a judicial act. I owe that criticism to
my client, and they would admit its truth. (§ I19)
So that the censure of some of that jury counts for
nothing : why, C. Geta became censor after having
himself been censured ! No infamy follows it, so it
can be no judgment, Anxious as our fathers were
for the purity of juries, they never made this a dis-
qualification. (§ I2l) Juries disregard it : so do
praetors in choosing a jury panel : censors disregard
their predecessors&apos; &apos; subscriptio,&apos; and even disagree
between themselves. (§ 123) To treat censure for a
charge as proof of the truth of the charge would be
to arm the censors with tyrannous power.

§ 124. So their censure is irrelevant, and we get back
as before to the original facts. Nothing is proved
against Cluentius : (§ 125) you hear Oppianicus&apos;
crimes. The censors (§ 126) themselves would admit
they followed mere rumour : their decision can be
questioned, as I successfully questioned it in Matrinius&apos;
case. (§ 127) Besides, why were Aquilius and
Gutta alone censured ? (§ 128). There is no analogy
to decimation, (§ 129) a censor should censure all
who are guilty. (§ 130) But they follow rumour ;
and there were other judicial scandals then : they
seized on men they knew to be rogues. (§ 131)
But they heard no defence : Gellius the censor
could know nothing of Oppianicus, and (§ 132) as
to Popilius, Lentulus disagreed.

(§ 133) It is said they censured Cluentius himself : that
was owing to current scandal. (§ 134) They should
have followed Africanus&apos; example in thc case of
Licinius Sacerdos.

(§ 135) ^i^h There is Egnatius&apos; will, disinheriting his son
for corruption on Oppianicus&apos; trial : a very foolish

will. Besides, Egnatius was ejected from the senate,
but his son was not.

(§§ 136, 137) 9th, There was a Senatus Consultum.
Naturally under the circumstances there would be,
but it named no one, and asserted nothing, and no
law was passed in consequence of it.

Last, \othy My own opinion in some speech. I merely
quoted common rumour, (§ 139) I did not know the
facts. It was an advocate&apos;s speech, and no judg-
ment. (§ 140) Speeches should not be quoted in
this sense. (§ 141) I may cite the conduct of L.
Crassus when attacked by M. Brutus. (§ 142)
The speech was a good piece of advocacy then.
Now I am better informed.

f43. You were wrong, Accius, in thinking I should only
rely on a technical defence. (§ 144) I do not
abandon it, but by Cluentius&apos; desire, expressed in
consultation, I am to rely on the merits, and a very
good defence they afford. It would have been
enough to have cited the Lex. (§ 146) Law is the
state&apos;s life : this court (§ 147), and all we who preside
in quaestiones, are bound by the law, and any one
may without shame avail himself of the law&apos;s pro-
tection. You, Accius, dare to argue that such a
defence is base. (§§ 148, 149) But Ckientius
clearly is not within the Lex, and is entitled to rely
on it, and though he waives it, I must and will
meet your argument. (§ 150) Base or not, it is the
law. Rank has its penalties ; the highest ordo has
a stricter law. (§ 151) C. Gracchus first enacted
this law, not against, but to protect, the people.
Sulla dared not extend it to the knights, though he
hated them, and (§ 152) few now wish to do so, and
those are men who would make the equites&apos; judgments
no longer independent. How nobly Pusio, Titinius,
and Maecenas in Drusus&apos; time expressed the equites&apos;
position. (§§ 156, 157) Cluentius waives his legal
right, but otherwise I should rely on it. I must
stand up for the law. If Accius&apos; appeal to you, to
bring all alike within it, should stand, who of the
meanest would be safe ? (§ 158) In any other man&apos;s

case I would have pressed the point, and you
would have accepted my view. (§§ 159, 160) The
law binds you, and if Accius had thought a little,
he would not have suggested the contrary.

IIL

Now I deal with the substantial charges, for out of mere
shame they had to urge some besides mere prejudice.

(§ 161) {a) It is said Cluentius&apos; slaves attacked Decidius :
why, Cluentius was most generous to him ! {l?) that
they attacked the shepherds of Pacenus and
Ancharius : it was a mere squabble ; (§ 162) (c) that he
was Aelius&apos; /ieres, to the exclusion of a nearer relative
— a high tribute to Cluentius&apos; merit ! he had nothing
to do with making the will ; (&lt;/) that he disputed a
legacy to Florus : nay, but he was at once cautious
and liberal. Ceius too he treated generously.
(§ 163) Ennius&apos; case is trumped up : I hear his charge
of assault is due to your subornation. I will handle
him in his turn. (§ 164) And this is all they could
rake up in eight years !

(§ 165) And now we come to the real charge in the case,
that of poisoning, ist, Vibius Cappadox : that is easily
disproved ; and, 2d, (§ 166) young Oppianicus, (§ 167)
a crime foreign to Cluentius&apos; whole career : impro-
bable in detail, and without motive. (§ 168) Besides,
the suggested victim Balbutius did not die as de-
scribed at all, but after an illness of some days.
[P&apos;ather&apos;s Deposition read. ]

(§ 169) This last charge shows that it is the implacable
Sassia who is at the bottom of it all. The charge of
poisoning Oppianicus the elder through M. Asellius
is (§ 170) without any motive, either of fear or gain.
Hatred would have prompted him to leave his enemy
alive in his misery ; (§ 171) death, unless we believe
fables about Hades, would have been a blessing ;
(§ 172) and what connection had he with Asellius ?
Asellius was his foe and Oppianicus&apos; friend. Why
was he not prosecuted too? (§ 173) The mode of
giving the poison is very unlikely, and Oppianicus
(§§ 174 and 175) did not die suddenly, in fact, but of
a fall from his horse while still an invalid.

(§ 176) Sassia at once began to plot. She bought of

Rupilius, Oppianicus&apos; doctor, his slave Strato, and
put him with Ascla, a slave of her ovi^n, and Nico-
stratus, whom she compelled young Oppianicus to
give up, to the torture. But respectable witnesses
being there they confessed nothing, (§ 177) and on a
second occasion her intent became plain, and the
inquiry was closed. (§ 178) Sassia went in dudgeon to
Larinum, and rewarded Strato, the supposed murderer
of her husband, by setting him up as a doctor.
(§ 179) After three years, to secure young Oppianicus, she
betrothed to him, against his will, her daughter by
her own son-in-law : (§§ 180 and l8l) and then, Strato
being tried for a theft, she reopened the old charge,
and tortured him and Nicostratus without (§ 182) any
independent witness. (§ 183) Accius did not say so,
but can it be that during the inquiry about his theft

Strato told about the poison ? (§§ 184 and 185) No ;
the minutes do not bear it out. They say nothing of
the theft. They are forged by Sassia. (§ 186) There
was but one witness, and he is not called before you.
(§ 187) Why was the inquiry held, then ? why are not
the slaves called now? Why, Strato has been crucified^
with his tongue cut out !
(§ 188) What a monster must Sassia be ! She was partner
in all Oppianicus&apos; crimes. (§ 190) To secure a pro-
secutor for her son, she bound young Oppianicus to
her by every tie. (§ 191) She trumped up the whole
charge, (§ 192) and is now here to help the prosecu-
tion and exult over her son. All the way to Rome
men flocked to see her pass, and to groan at her :
{§ 193) they thought she polluted tbe road she trod ;
(§ 194) as she passed, no one would give her shelter.
Her aim is to ruin her son, and she resorts even to
magic.

Peroration.

(§ 195) Save Cluentius from his mother. All Larinum is
here to aid him. (§ 196) They think the town itself is
on its trial. [Laudationes read.] (§ 197) See their
decurions here, with the Frentani, Marrucini, men of
Teanum Apulum and Luceria and others. L. Vohi
sienus, Helvidius Rufus, Cn. Tudicius, all areanxious
for him ; (§§ 199, 200) protect him then against this
infamous woman ; (§20l) be not swayed by prejudice :
(§ 202) he has felt its weight long enough already.

M. TULLII CICERONIS
PRO A. CLUENTIO HABITO

ORATIO AD lUDIGES.

I. I. Animadverti, iudices, omnem accusatoris orationem
in duas divisam esse partes, quarum altera mihi niti et magno
opere confidere videbatur invidia iam inveterata iudicii luniani,
altera tantum modo consuetudinis causa timide et diffidenter
attingere rationem veneficii criminum, qua de re lege est haec 5
quaestio constituta. Itaque mihi certum est hanc eandem
distributionem invidiae et criminum sic in defensione servare,
ut omnes intellegant nihil me nec subt.erfugere voluisse reticendo
nec obscurare dicendo. 2, Sed cum considero quo modo
mihi in utraque re sit elaborandum, altera pars et ea, quae 10
propria est iudicii vestri et legitimae veneficii quaestionis, per
mihi brevis et non magnae in dicendo contentionis fore videtur,
altera autem, quae procul ab iudicio remota est, quae con-
tionibus seditiose concitatis accommodatior est quam tranquilHs
moderatisque iudiciis, perspicio quantum in agendo difficultatis 15
et quantum laboris sit habitura. 3. Sed in hac difficultate illa
me res tamen, iudices, consolatur, quod vos de criminibus sic
audire consuestis, ut eorum omnem dissolutionem ab oratore
quaeratis, ut non existimetis plus vos ad salutem reo largiri

Iportere, quam quantum defensor purgandis criminibus con- 20
iqui et dicendo probare potuerit : de invidia autem sic inter
os disceptare debetis, ut non quid dicatur a nobis, sed quid
porteat dici consideretis. . Agitur enim in criminibus A.
;

2 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [i. 4

Cluenti proprium periculum, in invidia causa communis.
Quam ob rem alteram partem causae sic agemus, ut vos do-
ceamus, alteram sic, ut oremus. In altera diligentia vestra
nobis adiungenda est, in altera fides imploranda. Nemo est
5 enim qui invidiae sine vestro ac sine talium virorum subsidio
possit resistere. 4. Equidem quod ad me attinet, quo me
vertam nescio : negem fuisse illam infamiam iudicii corrupti ?
negem esse illam rem agitatam in contionibus, iactatam in
iudiciis, commemoratam in senatu? evellam ex animis hominum

10 tantam opinionem, tam penitus insitam, tam vetustam ? Non
est nostri ingenii : vestri auxilii est, iudices, huius innocentiae
sic in hac calamitosa fama quasi in aliqua perniciosissima
flamma atque in communi incendio subvenire.

II. 5. Etenim sicut aliis in locis parum firmaraenti et

15 parum virium veritas habet, sic in hoc loco falsa invidia
imbecilla esse debet : dominetur in contionibus, iaceat in
iudiciis : valeat in opinionibus ac sermonibus imperitorum,
ab ingeniis prudentium repudietur : vehementes habeat re-
pentinos impetus, spatio interposito et causa cognita conse-

20 nescat : denique illa definitio iudiciorum aequorum, quae
nobis a maioribus tradita est, retineatur, ut [in iudiciis] et
sine invidia culpa plectatur et sine culpa invidia ponatur.
6. Quam ob rem a vobis, iudices, ante quam de ipsa causa
dicere incipio, haec postulo : primum id, quod aequissimum

25 est, ut ne quid huc praeiudicati adferatis (etenim non modo
auctoritatem, sed etiam nomen iudicum amittemus, nisi hic
ex ipsis causis iudicabimus ac si ad causas iudicia iam facta
domo deferemus) ; deinde si quam opinionem iam vestris
mentibus comprehendistis, si eam ratio convellet, si oratio

30 labefactabit, si denique veritas extorquebit, ne repugnetis
eamque animis vestris aut libentibus aut aequis remittatis ;
tum autem, cum ego una quaque de re dicam et diluam, ne
ipsi, quae contraria sint, taciti cogitationi vestrae subiciatis,

I

sed ad extremum exspectetis meque meum dicendi ordinem
servare patiamini : cum peroraro, tum, si quid erit praeteri-
tum, [animo] requiratis. ^-

III. 7. Ego me, iudices, ad eam causam accedere, quae
iam per annos octo continuos ex contraria parte audiatur 5
atque ipsa opinione hominum tacita prope convicta atque
damnata sit, facile intellego : sed si qui mihi deus vestram
ad me audiendum benevolentiam conciHarit, efficiam profecto,

ut intellegatis nihil esse homini tam timendum quam in
vidiam, nihil innocenti suscepta invidia tam optandum quam 10
aequum iudicium, quod in hoc uno denique falsae infamiae
finis ahqui atque exitus reperiatur. Quam ob rem magna
me spes tenet, si quae sunt in causa, expHcare atque omnia
dicendo consequi potuero, hunc locum consessumque
vestrum, quem ilH horribilem A. Cluentio ac formidolosum 15
fore putaverunt, eum tandem eius fortunae miserae multum-
que iactatae portum ac perfugium futurum. 8. Tametsi
permulta sunt, quae mihi, ante quam de causa dico, de
communibus invidiae pericuHs dicenda esse videantur, tamen,
ne diutius oratione mea suspensa exspectatio vestra teneatur, 20
adgrediar ad crimen cum iUa deprecatione, iudices, qua mihi
saepius utendum esse intehego, sic ut me audiatis, quasi
hoc tempore haec causa primum dicatur, sicuti dicitur, non
quasi saepe iam dicta et numquam probata sit. Hodierno
enim die primum [veteris] ipsius criminis diluendi potestas 25
est data, ante hoc tempus error in hac causa atque invidia •
versata est. Quam ob rem dum multorum annorum
accusationi breviter dilucideque respondeo, quaeso, ut me,
iudices, sicut facere instituistis, benigne attenteque audiatis.

IV. 9. Corrupisse dicitur A. Cluentius iudicium pecunia, 30
quo inimicum innocentem Statium Albium condemnaret.
Ostendam, iudices, primum, quoniam caput ihius atrocitatis
atque invidiae fuit, innocentem pecunia circumventum.

4 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [iv. lo

neminem mTiquam maioribus criminibus, gravioribus testibus
esse in iudicium vocatum : deinde ea de eo praeiudicia esse
facta ab ipsis iudicibus, a quibus condcmnatus est, ut non
modo ab isdem, sed ne ab aliis quidem ullis absolvi ullo
5 modo posset. Cum haec docuero, tum illud ostendam,
quod maxime requiri intellego, iudicium illud pecunia esse
temptatum non a Cluentio, sed contra Cluentium, faciamque
ut intellegatis in tota illa causa quid res ipsa tulerit, quid
error adfinxerit, quid invidia conflarit.

lo 10. Primum igitur illud est, ex quo intellegi possit,
debuisse Cluentium magno opere causae confidere, quod
certissimis criminibus et testibus fretus ad accusandum
descenderit. Hoc loco faciendum mihi, iudices, est, ut
vobis breviter illa, quibus Albius est condemnatus, crimina

15 exponam. Abs te peto, Oppianice, ut me invitum de patris
tui causa dicere existimes, adductum fide atque ofiicio
defensionis. Etenim tibi si in praesentia satis facere non
potuero, tamen multae mihi ad satis faciendum rehquo
tempore facultates dabuntur : Cluentio ni nunc satis fecero,

2« postea mihi satis faciendi potestas non erit. Simul et illud
quis est qui dubitare debeat, contra damnatum et mortuum
pro incolumi et pro vivo dicere ? cum illi, in quem dicitur,
damnatio omne ignominiae periculum iam abstulerit, mors
vero etiam doloris : hic autem, pro quo dicimus, nihil possit

25 offensionis accipere sine acerbissimo animi sensu ac molestia
et sine summo dedecore vitae et turpitudine. II. Atque
ut intellegatis Cluentium non accusatorio animo, non osten-
tatione ahqua aut gloria adductum, sed nefariis iniuriis,
cotidianis insidiis, proposito ante oculos vitae periculo,

30 nomen Oppianici detulisse, paulo longius exordium rei
demonstrandae petam : quod quaeso, iudices, ne moleste
patiamini : principiis enim cognitis multo facihus extrema
intellegetis. &apos; .

V. A. Cluentius Habitus fuit, pater huiusce, iudices, homo
non solum municipii Larinatis, ex quo erat, sed etiam re-
gionis illius et vicinitatis virtute, existimatione, nobilitate fa-
cile princeps. Is cum esset mortuus Sulla et Pompeio con-
sulibus, reliquit hunc annos xv natum, grandem autem et 5
nubilem filiam, quae brevi tempore post patris mortem nup-
sit A. Aurio Melino, consobrino suo, adulescenti in primis,
ut tum habebatur, inter suos et honesto et nobih./ 12. Cum
essent eae nuptiae plenae dignitatis, plenae concordiae, re-
pente est exorta muHeris importunae nefaria Hbido non so- 10
lum dedecore, verum etiam scelere coniuncta. Nam Sassia,
mater huius Habiti — mater enim a me in omni causa, tametsi
in hunc hostiH odio et crudeHtate est, mater, inquam, appel-
labitur, neque umquam iila ita de suo scelere et immanitate
audiet, ut naturae nomen amittat : quo enim est ipsum nomen 15
amantius indulgentiusque maternum, hoc ilHus matris, quae
multos iam annos et nunc cum maxime fiHum interfectum
cupit, singulare scelus maiore odio dignum esse ducetis —
ea igitur mater Habiti, MeHni iUius adulescentis, generi sui,
contra quam fas erat, amore capta, primo, neque id ipsum 20
diu, quoquo modo poterat, in iHa cupiditate se continebat :
deinde ita flagrare coepit amentia, sic inflammata ferri libi-
dine, ut eam non pudor, non pudicitia, non pietas, non ma-
cula familiae, non hominum fama, non fiHi dolor, non fiHae
maeror a cupiditate revocaret. 13. Animum adulescentis, 25
nondum consilio ac ratione firmatum, peUexit eis omnibus
rebus, quibus iUa aetas capi ac deUniri potest. Filia, quae
non solum illo communi dolore muHebri in eius modi viri
iniuriis angeretur, sed nefarium matris peHcatum ferre non

osset, de quo ne queri quidem se sine scelere posse arbi- 30
traretur, ceteros sui tanti mali ignaros esse cupiebat : in
huius amantissimi sui fratris manibus et gremio maerore et
lacrimis consenescebat. 14. Ecce autem subitum divortium.

\

6 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [vi. 15

quod solacium malorum omnium fore videbatur. Discedit a
Melino Cluentia, ut in tantis iniuriis non invita, ut a viro non
libenter. Tum vero illa egregia et praeclara mater palam
exsultare laetitia, triumphare gaudio coepit, victrix filiae,
5 non libidinis : diutius suspicionibus obscuris laedi famam
suam noluit : lectum illum genialem, quem biennio ante
filiae suae nubenti straverat, in eadem domo sibi ornari et
sterni expulsa atque exturbata filia iubet. Nubit genero
socrus, nullis auspicibus, nuUis auctoribus, funestis ominibus

10 omnium.

VI. 15. O mulieris scelus incredibile et praeter hanc unam
in omni vita inauditum ! o hbidinem effrenatam et indom-
itam ! o audaciam singularem ! nonne timuisse, si minus vim
deorum hominumque famam, at illam ipsam noctem faces-

15 que illas nuptiales ? non hmen cubicuh? non cubile fihae?
non parietes denique ipsos, superiorum testes nuptiarum?
Perfregit ac prostravit omnia cupiditate ac furore : vicit pu-
dorem hbido, timorem audacia, rationem amentia. 16. Tuht
hoc commune dedecus famihae, cognationis, nominis graviter

20 fihus : augebatur autem eius molestia cotidianis querimoniis
et adsiduo fletu sororis : statuit tamen nihil sibi in tantis
iniuriis ac tanto scelere matris gravius esse faciendum, quam
ut iha matre ne uteretur, ne quae videre sine summo animi
dolore non poterat, ea, si matre uteretur, non solum videre,

25 verum etiam probare suo iudicio putaretur.

17. Initium quod huic cum matre fuerit simultatis audistis.
Pertinuisse hoc ad causam tum, cum rehqua cognoveritis,
intehegetis. Nam ihud me non praeterit, cuiuscumque modi
sit mater, tamen in iudicio fihi de turpitudine parentis dici vix

30 oportere. Non essem ad uham causam idoneus, iudices, si
hoc, quod in communibus hominum sensibus atque in ipsa
natura positum atque infixum est, id ego, qui ad hominum
pericula defendenda adiungerer, non viderem. Facile intel-

VII. 20] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 7

lego non modo reticere homines parentum iniurias, sed etiam
animo aequo ferre opprtere. Sed ego ea, quae ferri possunt,
ferenda, quae taceri, tacenda esse arbitror. l8. Nihil in vita
vidit calamitatis A. Cluentius, nulkim periculum mortis adiit,
nihil maU timuit, quod non totum a matre esset conflatum et 5
profectum. Quae hoc tempore sileret omnia, atque ea, si
obhvione non posset, tamen taciturnitate sua tecta esse
pateretur : sed vero sic agitur, ut prQjsus reticeri nullo modo
possit. Hoc enim ipsum iudicium, hoc periculum, illa
accusatio, omnis testium copia, quae futura est, a matre ini- 10
tio est adornata, a matre hoc tempore instruitur atque omnibus
eius opibus et copiis comparatur. Ipsa denique nuper Larino
huius opprimendi causa Romam advolavit : praesto est muHer
audax, pecuniosa, crudelis : instituit accusatores, instruit
testes, squalgre huius et sordibus laetatur, exitium exoptat, 15
sanguinem suum profundere omnem cupit, dum modo pro-
fusum huius ante videat. Haec nisi omnia perspexeritis in
causa, temere a nobis illam appellari putatote : sin erunt et
aperta et nefaria, Cluentio ignoscere debebitis, quod haec a
me dici patiatur : mihi ignoscere non deberetis, si tacerem. 20

VII. 19. Nunc iam summatim exponam quibus criminibus
Oppianicus damnatus sit, ut et constantiam A. Cluenti et
rationem accusationis perspicere possitis. Ac primum causa
accusandi quae fuerit ostendam, ut id ipsum A. Cluentium vi
ac necessitate coactum fecisse videatis. 20. Cum manifesto 25
venenum deprehendisset, quod vir matris Oppianicus ei
paravisset, et res non coniectura, sed ocuHs ac manibus
teneretur, neque in causa uUa dubitatio posset esse, accusavit
Oppianicum : quam constanter et quam diHgenter postea
dicam : nunc hoc scire vos volui, nuUam huic aUam accusandi 30
causam fuisse, nisi uti j^ropositum vitae periculum et coti-
dianas capitis insidias hac una ratione evitaret. Atque ut
inteUegatis eis accusatum essc criminibus Oppianicum, ut

8 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [vii. 21

neque accusator timere neque reus sperare potuerit, pauca
vobis illius iudicii crimina exponam : quibus cognitis nemo
vestrum mirabitur illum diffidentem rebus suis ad Staienum
atque ad pecuniam confugisse.
5 21. Larinas quaedam fuit Dinaea, socrus Oppianici, quae
filios habuit M. et N. Aurios et Cn. Magium et filiam Magiam,
nuptam Oppianico. M. Aurius adulescentulus bello Italico
captus apud Asculum in Q. Sergi senatoris, eius qui inter
sicarios damnatus est, manus incidit et apud eum in ergastulo

10 fuit. Numerius autem Aurius frater eius mortuus est here-
demque Cn. Magium fratrem reliquit. F&lt;^^a Magia uxor
Oppianici mortua est : postremo, unus qui reliquus erat Di-
naeae filius, Cn. Magius est mortuus. Is heredem fecit illum
adulescentem Oppianicum sororis suae filium eumque partiri

15 cum Dinaea matre iussit. Interim venit index ad Dinaeam
neque obscurus neque incertus, qui nuntiaret ei fiHum eius,
M. Aurium, vivere et in agro Gallico esse in servitute. 22.
Mulier amissis Hberis cum unius reciperandi filii spes esset
ostentata, omnes suos propinquos filiique sui necessarios

20 convocavit et ab eis flens petivit, ut negotium susciperent,
adulescentem investigarent, sibi restituerent eum filium, quem
tamen unum ex multis fortuna reliquum esse voluisset. Haec
cum agere instituisset, oppressa morbo est. Itaque testa-
mentum fecit eius modi, ut illi filio HS cccc milia legaret,

25 heredem institueret eundem illum Oppianicum, nepotem
suum. Atque his diebus paucis est mortua. Propinqui
tamen illi, quem ad modum viva Dinaea instituerant, ita
mortua illa ad investigandum M. Aurium cum eodem illo
indice in agrum Gallicum profecti sunt. ^

30 VIII. 23. Interim Oppianicus, ut erat, sicuti ex multis
rebus reperietis, singulari scelere et audacia, per quendam
GaUicanum, famiUarem suum, primum iUum indicem pecunia
corrupit : deinde ipsum M. Aurium non magna iactura facta

IX. 25] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 9

tollendum interficiendumque curavit. Illi autem, qui erant
ad propinquum investigandum et reciperandum profecti,
litteras Larinum ad Aurios illius adulescentis suosque neces-
sarios mittunt, sibi difficilem esse investigandi rationem, quod
intellegerent indicem ab Oppianico esse corruptum. Quas 5
litteras A. Aurius, vir fortis et experiens et domi nobilis et M.
illius Auri perpropinquus, in foro, palam, multis audientibus,
cum adesset Oppianicus, recitat et clarissima voce se nomen
Oppianici, si interfectum M. Aurium esse comperisset, delaturum
esse testatur. 24. Interimbrevi tempore illi, qui erant in agrum 10
Gallicum profecti, Larinum revertuntur : interfectum esse M.
Aurium renuntiant. Animi non solum propinquorum, sed
etiam omnium Larinatium odio Oppianici et illius adulescentis
misericordia commoventur. Itaque cum Aurius, is qui antea
denuntiarat, clamore hominem ac minis insequi coepisset, 15
Larino profugit et se in castra clarissimi viri, Q. Metelli, con-
tulit. 25. Post illam autem fugam et sceleris et conscientiae
testem numquam se iudiciis, numquam legibus, numquam
ineniium inimicis committere ausus est, sed per illam L. Sullae
vim atque victoriam Larinum in summo timore omnium cum 20
armatis advolavit : quattuorviros, quos municipes fecerant,
sustulit : se a Sulla et tres praeterea factos esse dixit et ab
eodem sibi esse imperatum, ut Aurium illum, qui sibi dela-
tionem nominis et capitis periculum ostentarat, et alterum
Aurium et eius L. filium et Sex. Vibium, quo sequestre in 25
illo indice corrumpendo dicebatur esse usus, proscribendos
interficiendosque curaret. Itaque illis crudelissime interfectis
non mediocri ab eo ceteri proscriptionis et mortis metu
tenebantur. His rebus in causa iudicioque patefactis quis est
qui illum absolvi potuisse arbitretur? 30

IX. Atque haec parva sunt : cognoscite reliqua, ut non
uando condemnatum esse Oppianicura, sed aliquam diu
incolumem fuisse miremini.

10 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [ix. 26

26. Primum videte hominis audaciam. Sassiam in matri-
monium ducere, Habiti matrem, illam, cuius virum A. Aurium
occiderat, concupivit. Utrum impudentior hic, qui postulet,
an crudehor illa, si nubat, difficile dictu est : sed taraen
5 utriusque humanitatem constantiamque cognoscite. 2*]. Petit
Oppianicus, ut sibi Sassia nubat, et id magno opere contendit.
IUa autem non admiratur audaciam, non impudentiam asper-
natur, non denique illam Oppianici domum viri sui sanguine
redundantem reformidat, sed quod haberet ille tres filios,

10 idcirco se ab eis nuptiis abhorrere respondit. Oppianicus,
qui pecuniam Sassiae concupivisset, domo sibi quaerendum
remedium existimavit ad eam moram, quae nuptiis adfere-
batur. Nam cum haberet ex Novia infantem fiHum, alter
autem eius fiHus, Papia natus, Teani ApuH, quod abest a

15 Larino xviii miHa passuum, apud matrem educaretur, arcessit
subito sine causa puerum Teano : quod facere nisi ludis aut
festis diebus antea non solebat. Mater misera nihil maH
suspicans mittit. Ille se Tarentum proficisci cum simulasset,
eo ipso die puer, hora undecima cum valens in pubHco visus

20 esset, ante noctem mortuus et postridie ante quam luceret
combustus est. 28. Atque hunc tantum maerorem matri
prius hominum rumor quam quisquam ex Oppianici famiHa
nuntiavit. IHa cum uno tempore audisset sibi non solum
fiHum, sed etiam exsequiarum munus ereptum, Larinum con-

25 festim exanimata venit et ibi de integro funus iam sepulto fiHo
fecit. Dies nondum decem intercesserant, cum iHe alter fiHus
infans necatur. Itaque nubit Oppianico continuo Sassia,
laetanti iam animo et spe optime confirmato. Nec mirum,
quae se non nuptiaHbus donis, sed fiHorum funeribus esse

30 deHnitam videret. Ita quod ceteri propter Hberos pecuniae
cupidiores solent esse, iUe propter pecuniam Hberos arnittere
iucundum esse duxit.

sceleribus breviter a me demonstratis vehementer esse com-
motos. Quo tandem igitur animo fuisse illos arbitramini,
quibus his de rebus non modo audiendum fuit, verum etiam
iudicandum ? Vos auditis de eo, in quem iudices non estis, de
eo, quem non videtis, de eo, quem odisse iam non potestis, 5
de eo, qui et naturae et legibus satis fecit, quem leges exsiho,
natura morte multavit : auditis non ab inimico, auditis sine
testibus, auditis, cum ea, quae copiosissime dici possunt,
breviter a me strictimque dicuntur. Illi audiebant de eo,
de quo iurati sententias ferre debebant, de eo, cuius praesen- 10
tis nefarium et consceleratum voltum intuebantur, de eo, quem
omnes oderant propter audaciam, de eo, quem omni suppUcio
dignum esse ducebant : audiebant ab accusatoribus, audie-
bant verba muUorum testium, audiebant, cum una quaque de
re a P. Cannutio, homine eloquentissimo, graviter et diu 15
diceretur. 30. Et est quisquam qui cum haec cognoverit,
suspicari possit Oppianicum iudicio oppressum et circumven-
tum esse innocentem ?

Acervatim iam reUqua, iudices, dicam, ut ad ea, quae
propiora huiusce causae et adiunctiora sunt, perveniam : vos, 20
quaeso, memoria teneatis non mihi hoc esse propositum,
u t ac cusem Oppianicum mortuum, sed cum hoc persuadere
vobis vehm, iudicium ab hoc non esse corruptum, hoc uti
initio ac fundamento defensionis, Oppianicum hominem
sceleratissimum et nocentissimum esse damnatum. Qui 25
uxori suae Cluentiae, quae amita huius Habiti fuit, cum
ipse poculum dedisset, subito iUa in media potione exclam-
avit se maximo cum dolore emori : nec diutius vixit q0a,m
locuta est : nam in ipso sermone hoc et vociferatione mortua
est. Et ad hanc mortem repentinam, vocesque morientis 30
omnia praeterea, quae solent esse indicia et vestigia veneni,
in iUius mortuae corpore fuerunt. Eodemque veneno C.
Oppianicum fratrem necavit.

12 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xi. 31

XI. 31. Neque est hoc satis : tametsi in ipso fraterno
parricidio nullum scelus praetermissum videtur, tamen, ut ad
hoc nefarium facinus accederet, aditum sibi aliis sceleribus
ante munivit. Nam cum esset gravida Auria, fratris uxor,

5 et iam appropinquare partus putaretur, mulierem veneno
interfecit, ut una illud, quod erat ex fratre conceptum,
necaretur. Post fratrem adgressus est : qui sero iam exhausto
illo poculo mortis cum et de suo et de uxoris interitu
clamaret testamentumque mutare cuperet, in ipsa significa-

10 tione huius voluntatis est mortuus. Ita nmlierem, ne partu
eius ab hereditate fraterna excluderetur, necavit : fratris
autem Hberos prius vita privavit quam ilH hanc a natura
lucem accipere potuerunt : ut omnes intellegerent nihil ei
[clausum, nihil] sanctum esse posse, a cuius audacia fratris

15 Hberos ne materni quidem corporis custodiae tegere potu-
issent. 32, Memoria teneo Milesiam quandam muUerem,
cum essem in Asia, quod ab heredibus [secundis] accepta
pecunia partum sibi ipsa medicamentis abegisset, rei capitahs
esse damnatam : nec iniuria, quae spem parentis, memoriam

20 nominis, subsidium generis, heredem famiHae, designatum
rei pubHcae civem sustuHsset. Quanto est Oppianicus in
eadem iniuria maiore suppHcio dignus ! si quidem iUa, cum
suo corpori vim attuHsset, se ipsa cruciavit, hic autem idem
iHud efifecit per aheni corporis mortem atque cruciatum.

25 Ceteri non videntur in singuHs hominibus muHa parricidia
suscipere posse, Oppianicus inventus est qui in uno corpore
plures necaret.

XII. 33. Itaque, cum hanc eius consuetudinem audaci-
amque cognosset avuncuHis iHius adulescentis Oppianici, Cn.

30 Magius, isque, cum gravi morbo adfectus esset, heredem
Hlum sororis suae fiHum faceret, adhibitis amicis, praesente
matre sua, Dinaea, uxorem suam interrogavit, essetne praeg-
nans. Quae cum se esse respondisset, ab ea petivit, ut

XIII. 36] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 13

se mortuo apud Dinaeam, quae tum ei mulieri socrus erat,
quoad pareret, habitaret diligentiamque adhiberet, ut id,
quod conceperat, servare et salvum parere posset. Itaque ei
testamento legat grandem pecuniam a fiho, si qui natus erit :
ab secundo herede nihil legat. 34. Quid de Oppianico 5
suspicatus sit videtis : quid iudicapit obscurum non est.
Nam cuius fihum faceret heredem, eum tutorem hberis non
adscripsit. Quid Oppianicus fecerit cognoscite, ut illum
Magium intellegatis non longe animo prospexisse morientem.
Quae pecunia muheri legata erat a fiho, si qui natus erit, lo
eam praesentem Oppianicus non debitam muheri solvit, si
haec sohitio legatorum et non merces abortionis appehanda
est. Quo iha pretio accepto muhisque praeterea muneribus,
quae tum ex tabuhs Oppianici recitabantur, spem iham,
quam in alvo commendatam a viro continebat, victa avaritia 15
sceleri Oppianici vendidit. 35. Nihil posse iam ad hanc
improbitatem addi videtur : attendite exitum. Quae muher
obtestatione viri decem ihis mensibus ne domum quidem
uham nisi socrus suae nosse debuit, haec quinto mense post
viri mortem ipsi Oppianico nupsit. Quae nuptiae non 20
diuturnae fuerunt. Erant enim non matrimonii dignitate,
sed sceleris societate coniunctae.

XIII. 36. Quid? iUa caedes Asuvi Larinatis adulescentis
pecuniosi, quam clara tum recenti re fuit, quam omnium
sermone celebrata ! Fuit AviUius quidam Larino perdita 25
nequitia et summa egestate, arte quadam praeditus ad
hbidines adulescentulorum excitandas accommodata, qui ut
se blandiths et adsentationibus in Asuvi consuetudinem
penitus immersit, Oppianicus continuo sperare coepit, hoc
se AviUio tamquam aUqua machina admota capere Asuvi 30
adulescentiam et fortunas eius patrias expugnare posse.
Ratio excogitata Larini est, res translata Romam. Iniri
enim consUium facihus in sohtudine, perficere rem eius modi

14 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xiii. 37

commodius in turba posse arbitrati sunt. Asuvius cum
Avillio Romam est profectus : hos vestigiis Oppianicus
consecutus est. lam ut Romae vixerint, quibus conviviis,
quibus flagitiis, quantis et quam profusis sumptibus, non
5 modo conscio, sed etiam conviva et adiutore Oppianico,
longum est dicere mihi, praesertim ad aUa properanti.
Exitum huius adsimulatae famiHaritatis cognoscite. 37. Cum
esset adulescens apud muHerculam quandam atque, ubi per-
noctaret, ibi diem posterum commoraretur, AvilHus, ut erat

10 constitutum, simulat se aegrotare et testamentum facere
velle. Oppianicus obsignatores ad eum, qui neque Asuvium
neque AviHium nossent, adducit et iHum Asuvium appeHat
ipse. Testamento Asuvi nomine obsignato disceditur.
AviHius Hico convalescit. Asuvius autem brevi iHo tempore,

15 quasi in hortulos iret, in harenarias quasdam extra portam
EsquiHnam perductus occiditur. 38. Qui cum unum iam et
alterum diem desideraretur neque in iis locis, ubi ex con-
suetudine quaerebatur, inveniretur, et Oppianicus in foro
Larinatium dictitaret nuper se et suos amicos testamentum

20 eius obsignasse, Hberti Asuvi et non nuHi amici, quod eo die,
quo postremum Asuvius visus erat, AviHium cum eo fuisse
et a multis visum esse constabat, in eum invadunt et hominem
ante pedes Q. ManH, qui tum erat triumvir, constituunt :
atque iHe continuo, nuHo teste, nuHo indice, recentis male-

25 ficii conscientia perterritus, omnia, ut a me pauHo ante dicta
sunt, exponit Asuviumque a sese consiHo Oppianici inter-
fectum fatetur. 39. Extrahitur domo latitans Oppianicus
a ManHo : index AviHius ex altera parte coram tenetur, Hic
quid iam rehqua quaeritis ? ManHum plerique noratis : non

30 iHe honorem a pueritia, non studia virtutis, non uHum
existimationis bonae fructum umquam cogitarat : ex petulanti
atque improbo scurra in discordiis civitatis ad eam col-
umnam, ad quam muHorum saepe conviciis perductus erat,

XIV. 41] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 15

tum suffragiis populi pervenerat. Itaque [rem] cum Oppi-
anico transigit, pecuniam ab eo accipit, causam et susceptam
et tam manifestam relinquit. Ac tum in Oppianici causa
crimen hoc Asuvianum cum testibus multis tiim vero indicio
Avilli comprobabatur : in quo adligatum Oppianici nomen 5
primum esse constabat, eius, quem vos miserum atque
innocentem falso iudicio circumventum esse dicitis.

XIV. 40. Quid? aviam tuam, Oppianice, Dinaeam, cui
tu es heres, pater tuus non manifesto necavit? ad quam
cum adduxisset medicum illum suum, iam cognitum et 10
saepe victorem, [per quem interfecerat plurimos], muher
exclamat se ab eo nuUo modo curari vehe, quo curante
omnes suos perdidisset. Tum repente Anconitanum
quemdam, L. Clodium, pharmacopolam circumforaneum,
qui casu tum Larinum venisset, adgreditur et cum eo duobus 15
mihbus HS, id quod ipsius tabuhs est demonstratum, trans-
igit. L. Clodius, cum properaret, cui fora muUa restarent,
simul atque introductus est^ rem confecit : prima potione
muherem sustuht, neque postea Larini punctum est temporis
commoratus. 41. Eadem hac Dinaea testamentum faciente, 20
cum tabulas prchendisset Oppianicus, qui gener eius fuisset,
digito legata delevit et cum id muhis locis fecisset, post
mortem eius, ne hturis coargui posset, testamentum in ahas
tabulas transscriptum signis adulterinis obsignavit. MuUa
praetereo consuUo : etenim vereor ne haec ipsa nimium 25
muUa esse videantur : vos tamen similem sui eum fuisse in
ceteris quoque vitae partibus existimare debetis. Ihum
tabulas pubhcas Larini censorias corrupisse decuriones
universi iudicaverunt. Cum iho nemo iam rationem, nemo
rem uham contrahebat : nemo ihum ex tam muUis cognatis 30
et adfinibus tutorem umquam hberis suis scripsit : nemo
iUum aditu, nemo congressione, nemo sermone, nemo con-
vivio dignum iudicavit : omnes aspernabantur, omnes ab-

i6 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xiv. 42

horrebant, omnes ut aliquam immanem ac perniciosam bes-
tiam pestemque fugiebant. 42. Hunc tamen hominem tam
audacem, tam nefarium, tam nocentem numquam accusasset
Habitus, iudices, si id praetermittere suo salvo capite
5 potuisset. Erat huic inimicus Oppianicus : erat, sed tamen
erat vitricus : crudelis et huic infesta mater, at mater.
Postremo nihil tam remotum ab accusatione quam Cluentius
et natura et voluntate et instituta ratione vitae. Sed cum
esset haec ei proposita condicio, ut aut iuste pieque ac-

10 cusaret aut acerbe indigneque moreretur, accusare, quoquo
modo posset, quam illo modo emori maluit.

43. Atque ut hoc ita esse perspicere possitis, exponam
vobis Oppianici facinus manifesto compertum atque depre-
hensum : ex quo simul utrumque, et huic accusare et illi con-

15 demnari, necesse fuisse intellegetis.

XV. Martiales quidam Larini appellabantur, ministri
pubUci Martis atque ei deo veteribus institutis reUgionibusque
Larinatium consecrati : quorum cum satis magnus numerus
esset, cumque item, ut in SiciHa permulti Venerii sunt, sic

20 ilH Larini in Martis familia numerarentur, repente Oppianicus
eos omnes Hberos esse civesque Romanos coepit defendere.
Graviter id decuriones Larinatium cunctique municipes tu-
lerunt. Itaque ab Habito petiverunt, ut eam causam
susciperet pubHceque defenderet. Habitus cum se ab omni

25 eius modi negotio removisset, tamen pro loco, pro antiquitate
generis sui, pro eo, quod [se] non suis commodis, sed etiam
suorum municipum ceterorumque necessariorum natum esse
arbitrabatur, tantae voluntati universorum Larinatium deesse
noluit. 44. Suscepta causa Romamque delata magnae

30 cotidie contentiones inter Habitum et Oppianicum ex utrius-
que studio defensionis excitabantur. Erat ipse immani
acerbaque natura Oppianicus : incendebat eius amentiam
infesta atque inimica fiHo mater Habiti. Magni autem illi sua

XVI. 47] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 17

interesse arbitrabantur hunc a causa Martialium removeri.
Suberat etiam alia causa maior, quae Oppianici hominis avar-
issimi mentem maxime commovebat. 45. Nam Habitus
usque ad illius iudicii tempus nullum testamentum umquam
fecerat. Neque legare eius modi matri poterat animum 5
inducere, neque testamento nomen omnino praetermittere
parentis. Id cum Oppianicus sciret — neque enim erat obscu-
rum — intellegebat Habito mortuo bona eius omnia ad matrem
esse ventura : quae ab sese postea aucta pecunia maiore
praemio, orbata iilio minore periculo necaretur. Itaque his 10
rebus incensus, qua ratione Habitum veneno toliere conatus
sit cognoscite.

XVI. 46. C. et L. Fabricii fratres gemini fuerunt ex
municipio Alatrinati, homines inter se cum forma tum mori-
bus similes, municipum autem suorum dissimillimi, in quibus 15
quantus splendor sit, quam prope aequabilis, quam fere
omnium constans et moderata ratio vitae, nemo vestrum, ut
mea fert opinio, ignorat. His Fabriciis semper est usus
Oppianicus famiharissime. lam hoc fere scitis omnes, quan-
tam vim habeat ad coniungendas amicitias studiorum ac na- 20
turae similitudo. Cum illi ita viverent, ut nuUum quaestum
turpem esse arbitrarentur, cum omnis ab eis fraus, omnes
insidiae circumscriptionesque adulescentium nascerentur,
cumque essent vitiis atque improbitate omnibus noti, studiose,
ut dixi, ad eorum se familiaritatem multis iam ante annis 25
Oppianicus appUcarat. 47. Itaque tum sic statuit, per C.

Kabricium — nam L. erat mortuus — insidias Habito comparare.
rat illo tempore infirma valetudine Habitus. Utebatur
item medico non ignobili, s^d spectato homine, Cleophanto :
cuius servum Diogenem Fabricius ad venenum Habito dandum 30
^^e et pretio solhcitare coepit. Servus non incallidus et, ut res
^Bsa declaravit, frugi atque integer, sermonem Fabricii non est
^Rpernatus : rem ad dominum detulit : Cleophantus autem

I

i8 PRO A. CLURNTIO ORATIO. [xvi. 48

cum Habito est collocutus. Habitus statim cum M. Baebio
senatore, familiarissimo suo, communicavit : qui qua fide,
qua prudentia, qua diligentia fuerit meminisse vos arbitror. Ei
placuit ut Diogenem Habitus emeret a Cleophanto, quo
5 facilius aut comprehenderetur res eius indicio aut falsa esse
cognosceretur. Ne multa : Diogenes emitur : venenum diebus
paucis comparatur : multi viri boni cum ex occulto inter-
venissent, pecunia obsignata, quae ob eam rem dabatur,
in manibus Scamandri Uberti Fabriciorum deprehenditur.

10 48. Pro di immortales ! Oppianicum quisquam his rebus
cognitis circumventum esse dicet ?

XVn. Quis umquam audacior? quis nocentior? quis aper-
tior in iudicium adductus est ? Quod ingenium, quae facultas
dicendi, quae a quoquam excogitata defensio huic uni crimini

1 5 potuit obsistere ? Simul et illud quis est qui dubitet quin
hac re comperta manifesteque deprehensa auf obeunda mors
Cluentio aut suscipienda accusatio fuerit ?

49. Katis esse arbltror demonstratum, iudices, eis crimini-
bus accusatum esse Oppianicum, uti honeste absolvi nuUo

20 modo potuerit. Cognoscite nunc ita reum citatum esse iUum,
ut re semel atque iterum praeiudicata condemnatus in iudi-
cium venerit. Nam Cluentius, iudices, primum nomen eius
detuUt, cuius in manibus venenum deprehenderat. Is erat
libertus Fabriciorum Scamander. Integrum consilium, iudicii

25 corrupti nulla suspicio: simplex in iudicium causa, certa res,
unum crimen adlatum est. Hic tum C. Fabricius, is, de quo
ante dixi, qui hberto damnato sibi iUud impendere pericuhun
videret, quod mihi cum Alatrinatibus vicinitatem et cum
plerisque eorum magnum usum esse sciebat, frequentes eos

30 ad me domum adduxit. Qui quamquam de homine, sicut ne-
cesse erat, existimabant, tamen, quod erat ex eodem municipio,
suae dignitatis esse arbitrabantur eum quibus rebus possent
defendere: idque a me ut facerem et ut causam Scamandri

XIX. 52] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 19

susciperem petebant, in qua causa patroni omne periculum
continebatu.r. 50. Ego, qui neque illis talibus viris ac tam
amantibus mei rem possem ullam negare neque illud crimen
tantum ac tam manifestum esse arbitrarer, sicut ne illi quidem
ipsi, qui mihitum illam causam commendabant, arbitrabantur, 5
pollicitus eis sum me omnia quae vellent esse facturum.
- XVIII. Res agi coepta est : citatus est Scamander reus.
Accusabat P. Cannutius, homo in primis ingeniosus et in
dicendo exercitatus : accusabat autem ille quidem Scamandrum
verbis tribus : Venenum esse deprehensum : omnia tela 10
totius accusationis in Oppianicum coniciebantur, aperiebatur
causa insidiarum, Fabriciorum famiUaritas commemorabatur,
hominis vita et audacia proferebatur, denique omnis accusatio
varie graviterque tractata, ad extremum maniffesta veneni de-
prehensione conclusa est. 51. Hic ego tum ad responden- 15
dum surrexi : qua cura, di immortales ! qua sollicitudine ani-
mi ! quo timore ! Semper equidem magno cura metu incipio
dicere : quotienscumque dico, totiens mihi videor in iudicium
venire non ingenii solum, sed etiam virtutis atque officii, ne
aut id profiteri videar, quod non possim, quod est impudentiae, 20
aut non id efficere, quod possim, quod est aut perfidiae aut
neglegentiae. Tum vero ita sum perturbatus, ut omnia time-
rem : si nihil dixissem, ne infantissimus : si multa in eius
modi causa dixissem, ne impudentissimus existimarer.

XIX. Collegi me aliquando et ita constitui, fortiter esse 25
agendum ; ilh&apos; aetati, qua tum eram, solere laudi dari, etiam

in minus firmis causis hominum periculis non defuissem.

,que feci : sic pugnavi, sic omni ratione contendi, sic^ad
omnia confugi, quantum ego adsequi potui, remedia ac per-
fugia causarum, ut hoc, quod timide dicam, consecutus sim, 30

Ie quis iUi causae patronum defuisse arbitraretur. 52. Sed
1 quicquid ego apprehenderam, statim accusator extorquebat
jmanibus. Si quaesiveram quae inimicitiae Scamandro cum

|^Bla(

20 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xix. 53

Habito, fatebatur nullas fuisse, sed Oppianicum, cuius ille
minister fuisset, huic inimicissimum fuisse atque esse dicebat.
Sin autem illud egeram, nuUum ad Scamandrum morte Habiti
venturum emolumentum fuisse, concedebat, sed ad uxorem
5 Oppianici, hominis in uxoribus necandis exercitati, omnia
bona Habiti ventura fuisse dicebat. Cum illa defensione
usus essem, quae in libertinorum causis honestissima semper
existimata est, Scamandrum patrono esse probatum, fatebatur,
sed quaerebat cui probatus esset ipse patronus. 53. Cum

10 ego pluribus verbis in eo commoratus essem, Scamandro in-
sidias factas esse per Diogenem constitutumque inter eos alia
de re fuisse, ut medicamentum, non venenum Diogenes
adferret, hoc cuivis usu venire posse, quaerebat cur in eius
modi locum, tam abditum, cur solus, cur cum obsignata

15 pecunia venisset. Denique hoc loco causa testibus honestis-
simis hominibus premebatur. M. Baebius de suo consilio
Diogenem emptum, se praesente Scamandrum cum veneno
pecuniaque deprehensum esse dicebat. P. QuintiHus Varus,
homo summa religione et summa auctoritate praeditus, de

20 insidiis, quae fierent Habito, et de sollicitatione Diogenis
recenti re secum Cleophantum collocutum esse dicebat.
54. Atque in illo iudicio cum Scamandrum nos defendere
videremur, verbo ille reus erat, re quidem vera et periculo
tota accusatione Oppianicus. Neque id obscure ferebat nec

25 dissirnulare ullo modo poterat : aderat frequens, advocabat,
omni studio gratiaque pugnabat : postremo, id quod maximo
malo illi causae fuit, hoc ipso in loco, quasi reus ipse esset,
sedebat. Oculi omnium iudicum non in Scamandrum, sed
in Oppianicum coniciebantur : timor eius, perturbatio, sus-

30 pensus incertusque voltus, crebra coloris mutatio, quae erant
antea suspiciosa, haec aperta et manifesta faciebant.

XX. 55. Cum in consiHum iri oporteret, quaesivit ab
reo C. lunius c|uaesitor ex lege illa Cornelia, quae tum erat,

xxi. 57] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 21

clam an palam de se sententiam ferri vellet. De Oppianici
sententia responsum est, quod is Habiti familiarem lunium
esse dicebat, clam velle ferri. Itum est in consilium.
Omnibus sententiis praeter unam, quam suam Staienus esse
dicebat, Scamander prima actione condemnatus est. Quis 5
tum erat omnium qui Scamandro condemnato non iudicium
de Oppianico factum esse arbitraretur ? quid est illa damna-
tione iudicatum, nisi venenum id, quod Habito daretur, esse
quaesitum? Quae porro tenuissima suspicio collata in
Scamandrum est aut conferri potuit, ut is sua sponte necare 10
voluisse Habitum putaretuf&apos;?

56. Atque hoc tum iudicio facto et Oppianico re et exis-
timatione iam, lege et pronuntiatione nondum condemnato,
tamen Habitus Oppianicum reum statim non fecit. Voluit
cognoscere utrum iudices in eos solos essent severi, quos 15
venenum habuisse ipsos comperissent, an etiam consiHa
conscientiasque eius modi facinorum supphcio dignas iudica-
rent. Itaque C. Fabricium, quem propter famiharitatem
Oppianici conscium ihi facinori fuisse arbitrabatur, reum
statim fecit : utique ei locus primus constitueretur propter 20
causae coniunctionem impetravit. Hic tum Fabricius non
modo ad me meos vicinos et amicos Alatrinates non adduxit,
sed ipse eis neque defensoribus uti postea neque laudatoribus
potuit. 57* Rem enim integram hominis non alieni quamvis
suspiciosam defendere humanitatis esse putabamus, iudicatam 25
labefactare conari impudentiae. Itaque tum ille inopia et
necessitate coactus in causa eius modi ad Caepasios fratres
c onfugit, homines industrios atque eo animo, ut quaecumque
^^teicendi potestas esset data, in honore atque in beneficio
^^fconerent. 30

^^B XXI. lam hoc prope iniquissime comparatum est, quod
^^p morbis corporis, ut quisque est difficihimus, ita medicus
nobihssimus atque optimus quaeritur, in pericuhs capitis, ut

22 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xxi. 58

quaeque causa difficillima est, ita deterrimus obscurissimusque
patronus adhibetur : nisi forte hoc causae est, quod medici
nihil praeter artificium, oratores etiam auctoritatem praestare
debent. 58. Citatur reus, [agiturcausa:] paucis verbis accusat,
5 ut de re iudicata, Cannutius : incipit longo et alte petito pro-
oemio respondere maior Caepasius. Primo attente auditur eius
oratio ; erigebat animum iam demissum et oppressum Oppiani-
cus ; gaudebat ipse Fabricius : non intellegebat animos iudicum
non illius eloquentia, sed defensionis impudentia commoveri.

10 Postea quam de re coepit dicere, ad ea, quae erant in causa,
addebat etiam ipse nova quaedam vulnera, ut quamquam
sedulo faciebat, tamen interdum non defendere, sed praevari-
cari accusationi videretur. Itaque cum callidissime se dicere
putaret et cum illa verba gravissima ex intimo artificio de-

15 prompsisset : &apos;Respicite, iudices, hominum fortunas,
respicite dubios variosque casus, respicite C.
Fabrici senectutem&apos;: cum hoc &apos;respicite&apos; ornandae
orationis causa saepe dixisset, respexit ipse. At C. Fabricius
a subseUiis demisso capite discesserat. 59. Hic iudices

20 ridere, stomachari atque acerbe ferre patronus, causam sibi
eripi et se cetera de illo loco Respicite, iudices, non
posse dicere : nec quicquam propius est factum, quam ut
illum persequeretur et collo obtorto ad subselHa reduceret,
ut rehqua posset perorare. Ita tum Fabricius primum suo

25 iudicio. quod est gravissimum, deinde legis vi et sententiis
iudicum est condemnatus.

XXII. Quid est quod iam de Oppianici persona causa-
que phira dicamus? Apud eosdem iudices reus est factus,
cum his duobus praeiudiciis iam damnatus esset : ab isdem

30 autem iudicibus, qui Fabriciorum damnatione de Oppianico
iudicarant, locus ei primus est constitutus : accusatus est
criminibus gravissimis et eis, quae a me breviter dicta sunt,
et praeterea multis, quae ego omnia [nunc] omitto : accusatus

XXII. 62] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 23

est apud eos, qiii Scamandrum ministrum Oppianici, C. Fab-
ricium conscium maleficii condemnarant. 60. Utrum, per
deos immortales ! magis est mirandum, quod is condemnatus
est, an quod omnino respondere ausus est? Quid enim illi
iudices facere potuerunt? qui si innocentes Fabricios con- 5
demnassent, tamen in Oppianico sibi constare et superioribus
consentire iudiciis ,debuerunt. An vero illi sua per se ipsi
iudicia rescinderent, cum ceteri soleant in iudicando ne ab
aliorum iudiciis discrepent providere? et ei, qui Fabrici
libertum, quia minister in maleficio fuerat, patronum, quia 10
conscius, condemnassent, ipsum principem atque architectum
sceleris absolverent? et qui ceteros nuUo praeiudicio facto
tamen ex ipsa causa condemnassent, hunc, quem bis iam
condemnatum acceperant, liberarent? 61. Tum vero illa
iudicia senatoria non falsa invidia, sed vera atque insigni 15
turpitudine notata atque operta dedecore et infamia defensioni
locum nuUum reliquissent. Quid enim tandem illi iudices
responderent, si qui ab eis quaereret : &apos; condemnastis Scaman-
drum : quo crimine?&apos; &apos; nempe, quod Habitum per servum
medici veneno necare voluisset.&apos; &apos; quid Habiti morte Sca- 20
mander consequebatur ? &apos; &apos; nihil, sed administer erat Oppi-
anici.&apos; &apos; et condemnastis C. Fabricium : quid ita?&apos; &apos; quia,
cum ipse familiarissime Oppianico usus, libertus autem eius
in maleficio deprehensus esset, illum expertem eius consih&apos;i
fuisse non probabatur.&apos; Si igitur ipsum Oppianicum bis 25
suis iudiciis condemnatum absolvissent, quis tantam tur-
pitudinem iudiciorum, quis tantam inconstantiam rerum
iudicatarum, quis tantam Hbidinem iudicum ferre potuisset ?

62. Quod si hoc videtis, quod iam hac omni oratione
patefactum est, illo iudicio reum condemnari, praesertim ab 30
isdem iudicibus, qui duo praeiudicia fecissent, necesse fuisse,

Iimul ilkid videatis necesse est, nullam accusatoris esse
;ausam potuisse cur iudicium vellet corrumpere.

XXIII. Quaero enim de te, T. Acci, relictis iam ceteris
argumentis omnibus, num Fabricios quoque innocentes
condemnatos existimes, num etiam illa iudicia pecunia
corrupta esse dicas, quibus in iudiciis alter a Staieno solo
5 absolutus est, alter etiam ipse se condemnavit. Age, si
nocentes, cuius maleficii? num quid praeter venenum quae-
situm, quo Habitus necaretur, obiectum est ? num quid aliud
in illis iudiciis versatum est praeter hasce insidias Habito ab
Oppianico per Fabricium factas? Nihil, nihil, inquam,

10 aliud, iudices, reperietis. Exstat memoria : sunt tabulae
publicae : redargue me, si mentior : testium dicta recita :
doce in illorum iudiciis quid praeter hoc venenum Oppianici
non modo in criminis, sed in male dicti loco sit obiectum.
63. Multa dici possunt quare ita necesse fuerit iudicari, sed

15 ego occurram exspectationi vestrae, iudices. Nam etsi a
vobis sic audior, ut numquam benignius neque attentius
quemquam auditum putem, tamen vocat me aHo iam dudum
tacita vestra exspectatio, quae mihi obloqui videtur : * quid
ergo ? negasne illud iudicium corruptum esse ? &apos; Non nego,

20 sed ab hoc corruptum non esse confirmo. &apos; A quo igitur
est corruptum ? &apos; Opinor, primum, si incertum fuisset quis-
nam exitus ilHus iudicii futurus esset, veri simihus tamen
esset, eum potius corrupisse, qui metuisset ne ipse condem-
naretur, quam illum, qui veritiis esset ne alter absolveretur :

25 deinde cum esset non dubium quid iudicari necesse esset,
eum certe potius, qui sibi aHa ratione diffideret, quam eum,
qui omni ratione confideret : postremo certe potius illum,
qui bis apud eos iudices offendisset, quam eum, qui bis eis
causam probavisset. 64. Unum quidem certe nemo erit

30 tam inimicus Cluentio qui mihi non concedat : si constet
corruptum illud iudicium esse, aut ab Habito aut ab Op-
pianico esse corruptum. Si doceo non ab Habito, vinco
ab Oppianico : si ostendo ab Oppianico, purgo Habitum.

■ fec.

Quare, etsi satis docui rationem nullam huic corrumpencii
iudicii fuisse, ex quo intellegitur ab Oppianico esse cor-
ruptum, tamen de illo ipso separatim cognoscite.

XXIV. Atque ego illa non argumentabor, quae sunt
gravia vehementer : eum corrupisse, qui in periculo fuerit : 5
eum, qui metuerit : eum, qui spem salutis in aha ratione non
habuerit : eum, qui semper singulari fuerit audacia. Multa
sunt eius modi : verum cum habeam rem non dubiam, sed
apertam atque manifestam, enumeratio singulorum argu-
mentorum non est necessaria. 65« Dico C. Aelio Staieno 10
iudici pecuniam grandem Statium Albium ad corrumpen-
dum iudicium dedisse. Num quis negat ? Te, Oppianice,
appello : te, Acci : quorum alter eloquentia damnationem
illam, alter tacita pietate deplorat. Audete negare ab
Oppianico Staieno iudici ])ecuniam datam : negate, inquam, 15
meo loco. Quid tacetis ? an negare non potestis, quod
repetistis, quod confessi estis, quod abstulistis? Quo
tandem igitur ore mentionem corrupti iudicii facitis, cum ab
ista parte iudici pecuniam ante iudicium datam, post iudicium
ereptam esse fateamini ? 66. Quoham igitur haec modo 20
gesta sunt ? Repetam pauUo altius, iudices, et omnia, quae
in diuturna obscuritate latuerunt, sic aperiam, ut ea cernere
ocuUs videamini. Vos quaeso, ut adhuc me attente audistis,
ut item, quae reliqua sunt, audiatis : profecto nihil a me
dicetur, quod non dignum hoc conventu et silentio, dignum 25
vestris studiis atque auribus esse videatur.

Nam ut primum Oppianicus ex eo, quod Scamander reus
erat factus, quid sibi impenderet coepit suspicari, statim se ad
hominis egentis, audacis, in iudiciis corrumpendis exercitati,
tum autem iudicis, Staieni familiaritatem se applicavit. Ac 30
primum Scamandro reo tantum donis datis muneribusque per-
fecerat, ut eo fautore uteretur cupidiore, quam fides iudieis
postulabat. 67« Post autem cum esset Scamander unius

26 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xxv. 68

Staieni [sententia absolutus], patronus autem Scamandri ne
sua quidem sententia liberatus, acrioribus saluti suae remediis
subveniendum putavit. Tum ab Staieno, sicut ab homine ad
excogitandum acutissimo, ad audendum impudentissimo, ad
5 efficiendum acerrimo — haec enim ille et aliqua ex parte habe-
bat et maiore ex parte se habere simulabat — auxilium capiti
ac fortunis suis petere coepit.

XXV. lam hoc non ignoratis, iudices, ut etiam bestiae
fame monitae plerumque ad eum locum, ubi pastae sunt

lo aliquando, revertantur. 68. Staienus ille biennio ante, cum
causam bonorum Safini Atellae recepisset, sescentis miHbus
nummum se iudicium corrupturum esse dixerat : quae cum
accepisset a pupillo, suppressit : iudicioque facto nec Safinio
nec bonorum emptoribus reddidit. Quam cum pecuniam

15 profudisset et sibi nihil non modo ad cupiditates suas, sed ne
ad necessitatem quidem reliquisset, statuit ad easdem esse
sibi praedas ac suppressiones iudiciales revertendum. Itaque
cum Oppianicum iam perditum et duobus iugulatum prae-
iudiciis videret, promissis suis eum excitavit abiectum et

20 simul saluti desperare vetuit. Oppianicus autem orare homi-

nem coepit, ut sibi rationem ostenderet iudicii corrumpendi.

69. Ille autem, quem ad modum ex ipso Oppianico postea

est auditum, negavit quemquam esse in civitate praeter se qui

id efficere possit. Sed primo gravari coepit, quod aediHtatem

25 se petere cum hominibus nobiHssimis et invidiam atque offen-

&apos; sionem timere dicebat. Post exoratus initio permagnam
pecuniam poposcit : deinde ad id pervenit, quod confici
potuit : HS sescenta quadraginta miHa deferri ad se domum
iussit. Quae pecunia simul atque ad eum delata est, homo

30 impurissimus statim coepit in eius modi mente et cogitatione
versari, nihil esse suis rationibus utiHus quam Oppianicum
condemnari : iUo absoluto pecuniam iHam aut iudicibus dis-
pertiendam aut ipsi esse reddundam : damnato repetiturum

^^K biis,

esse neminem. 70. Itaque rem excogitat singularem. Atque
haec, iudices, quae vera dicuntur a nobis, facilius credetis, si
cum animis vestris longo intervallo recordari C. Staieni vitam
et naturam volueritis. Nam perinde ut opinio est de cuiusque
moribus, ita quid ab eo factum aut non factum sit existimari 5
potest. &apos;p

XXVI. Cum esset egens, sumptuosus, audax, callidus, perfi-
diosus, et cum domi suae miserrimis in locis et inanissimis
tantum nummorum positum videret, ad omnem malitiam et
fraudem versare suam mentem coepit : * ego dem iudicibus ? 10
mihi ipsi igitur praeter periculum et infamiam quid quaeretur ?
Nihil excogitem quam ob rem Oppianicum damnari necesse
sit ? Quid tandem — nihil enim est quod non fieri possit — si
quis eum forte casus ex periculo eripuerit, nonne reddundum
est? Praecipitantem igitur impellamus,&apos; inquit, &apos;et perditum 15
prosternamus.&apos; ^i. Capit hoc consilii, ut pecuniam quibus-
dam iudicibus levissimis polliceatur, deinde eam postea sup-
primat : ut, quoniam graves homines sua sponte severe
iudicaturos putabat, eos, qui leviores erant, destiUitione iratos
Oppianico redderet. Itaque, ut erat semper praeposterus atque 20
perversus, initium facit a Bulbo, et eum, quod iam diu nihil
quaesierat, tristem atque oscitantem leviter impellit. &apos; Quid
tu ? &apos; inquit, &apos; ecquid me adiuvas, Bulbe, ne gratis rei publicae
serviamus ? &apos; Ille vero, simul atque hoc audivit : &apos; ne gratis &apos; :
&apos; quo voles,&apos; inquit, &apos; sequar : sed quid adfers ? &apos; Tum ei quad- 25
raginta milia, siesset absolutus Oppianicus, poUicetur, et eum,
ut ceteros appellet, quibuscum loqui consuesset, rogat, atque
etiam ipse conditor totius negotii Guttam aspergit huic Bulbo.
72. Itaque minime amarus eis visus est, qui aHquid ex eius
sermone speculae degustarant. Unus et alter dies intercesserat, 30
cum res parum certa videbatur : sequester et confirmator pecu-
niae desiderabatur. Tum appellat hilarovultu hominem Bul-
bus, ut blandissime potest : &apos; quid tu,&apos; inquit, &apos; Paete?&apos; — hoc

28 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xxvii. 73

enim sibi Staienus cognomen ex imaginibus Aeliorum dele-
gerat, ne, si se Ligurem fecisset, nationis magis quam generis
uti cognomine videretur — * qua de re mecum locutus es, quae-
runt a me ubi sit pecunia.&apos; Hic ille planus improbissimus,
5 quaestu iudiciario pastus, qui illi pecuniae, quam condiderat,
spe iam atque animo incubaret, contrahit frontem — recorda-
mini faciem atque illos eius fictos simulatosque voltus —
queritur se ab Oppianico destitutum, et, qui esset totus ex
fraude et mendacio factus quique ea vitia, quae a natura habe-

10 bat, etiam studio atque artificio quodam malitiae condisset,
pulcre adseverat [sese ab Oppianico destitutum], atque hoc
addit testimonii, sua illum sententia, cum palam omnes laturi
essent, condemnatum iri.

XXVII. 73- Manarat sermo in consilio pecuniae quandam

15 mentionem inter iudices esse versatam. Res neque tam
fuerat occulta quam erat occultanda neque tam erat aperta
quam rei publicae causa aperienda. In ea obscuritate ac du-
bitatione omnium Cannutio, perito homini, qui quodam odore
suspicionis Staienum corruptum esse sensisset nequedum rem

20 perfectam arbitraretur, placuit repente pronuntiari : Dixerunt.
Hic tum Oppianicus non magno opere pertimuit : rem a
Staieno perfectam esse arbitrabatur. 74. In consiHum erant
ituri iudices xxxii. Sententiis xvi absokitio conjici
poterat. Quadragena milia nummum in singulos iudices dis-

25 tributa eum numerum sententiarum conficere debebant, ut ad
cumulum spe maiorum praemiorum ipsius Staieni sententia
septima decima accederet. Atque etiam casu tum, quod
illud repente erat factum, Staienus ipse non aderat. Caiisam
nescio quam apud iudicem defendebat^ Facile hoc Habitus

30 patiebatur, facile Cannutius : at non Oppianicus neque patro-
nus eius L. Quinctius : qui cum esset illo tempore tribunus
plebis, convicium C. lunio iudici quaestionis maximum fecit,
ut ne sine illo in consiUum iretur : cumque id ei per viatores

XXVIII. ^y&apos;] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 29

consulto neglegentius agi videretur, ipse e publico iudicio ad
privatum Staieni iudicium profectus est et illud pro potestate
dimitti iussit : Staienum ipse ad subsellia adduxit. 75- Con-
surgitur in consilium, cum sententias Oppianicus, quae tum
erat potestas, palam ferri velle dixisset, ut Staienus scire 5
posset quid cuique deberetur. Varia iudicum genera : num-
marii pauci, sed omnes irati. Ut qui accipere in Campo
consuerunt, eis candidatis, quorum nummos suppressos esse
putant, inimicissimi solent esse, sic eius modi iudices infesti
tum reo venerant : ceteri nocentissimum esse arbitrabantur, 10
sed exspectabant sententias eorum, quos corruptos esse puta-
bant, ut ex eis constituerent a quo iudicium corruptum
videretur.

XXVIII. Ecce tibi eius modi sortitio, ut in primis Bulbo et
Staieno et Guttae esset iudicandum. Summa omnium 15
exspectatio quidnam sententiae ferrent leyes ac nummarii
iudices. Atque illi omnes sine uUa dubitatione condemnant.
76. Hic tum iniectus est hominibus scrupulus et quaedam
dubitatio quidnam esset actum. Deinde homines sapientes
et ex vetere illa disciplina iudiciorum, qui neque absolvere 20
hominem nocentissimum possent neque eum, de quo esset
orta suspicio, pecunia oppugnatum, re illa incognita primo
condemnare vellent, non liquere dixerunt. NonnuUi autem
severi homines, qui hoc statuerunt, quo quisque animb quid
faceret spectari oportere, etsi ahi pecunia accepta verum 25
iudicabant, tamen nihilo minus se superioribus suis iudiciis
constare putabant oportere^: itaque damnarunt. Quinque
omnino fuerunt, qui illum vestrum innocentem Oppianicum
sive imprudentia sive misericordia sive ahqua suspicione sive
ambitione adducti absolverunt./&apos; 30

77« Condemnato Oppianico statim L. Quinctius, homo
maxime popularis, qui omnes rumorum et contionum ventos
coUigere consuesset, oblatam sibi facultatem putavit, ut ex

30 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xxviii. 7^

invidia senatoria posset crescere, quod eius ordinis iudicia
minus iam probari populo arbitrabatur. Habetur una atque
altera contio vehemens et gravis : accepisse pecuniam iu
dices, ut innocentem reum condemnarent, tribunus plebis
5 clamabat : agi fortunas omnium dicebat : nuUa esse iudicia :
qui pecuniosum inimicum haberet, incolumem esse neminem
posse. Homines totius ignari negotii, qui Oppianicum num-
(luam vidissent, virum optimum et hominem pudentissimum
pecunia oppressum esse arbitrarentur, incensi suspicione

lorem in medium vocare coeperunt et causam illam totam de-
poscere. 78- Atque illo ipso tempore in aedes T. Anni,
hominis honestissimi, necessarii et amici mei, noctu Staienus
arcessitus ab Oppianico venit. lam cetera nota sunt omni-
bus : ut cum illo Oppianicus egerit de pecunia, ut ille se red-

15 diturum esse dixerit, ut eum sermonem audierint omnem viri
boni, qui tum consulto propter in occulto stetissent : ut res
patefacta et in forum prolata et pecunia omnis Staieno extorta
atque erepta sit.

XXIX. Huius Staieni persona populo iam nota atque per-

20 specta ab nuUa turpi suspicione abhorrebat : suppressam esse
ab eo pecuniam, quam pro reo pronuntiasset, qui erant in
contione, non intellegebant. Neque enim docebantur. Ver-
satam esse in iudicio mentionem pecuniae sentiebant,
innocentem reum condemnatum audiebant : Staieni sententia

25 condemnatum videbant : non gratis id ab eo factum esse,
quod hominem norant, iudicabant. SimiHs in Bulbo, in
Gutta, in aUis non nuUis suspicio consistebat 79. Itaque
confiteor — licet enim iam impune hoc praesertim in loco
confiteri — , quod Oppianici non modo vita, sed etiam nomen

30 ante illud tempus populo ignotum fuisset, indignissimum porro
videretur circumventum esse innocentem pecunia, hanc deinde
suspicionem augeret Staieni improbitas et non nullorum eius
similium iudicum turpitudo, causam autem ageret L. Quinctius,

XXX. 81] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 31

homo cum summa potestate tum ad inflammandos animos
multitudinis accommodatus, summam illi iudicio invidiam
infamiamque esse conflatam, atque in hanc flammam recentem
tum C. lunium, qui illi quaestioni praefuerat, esse iniectum
memini, et illum hominem aedihcium, iam praetorem opinioni- 5
bus hominum constitutum, non disceptatione dicendi, sed
clamore de foro atque adeo de civitate esse sublatum.

80. Neque me paenitet hoc tempore potius quam illo
causam A. Ckienti defendere. Causa enim manet eadem,
quae mutari nullo modo potest, temporis iniquitas atque 10
invidia recessit, ut, quod in tempore maH fuit, nihil obsit,
quod in causa boni fuit, prosit. Itaque nunc quem ad modum
audiar sentio, non modo ab eis, quorum iudicium ac potestas
est, sed etiam ab iUis, quorum tantum est existimatio. Al
tum si dicerem, non audirer, non quod aUa res esset, immo 15
eadem, sed tempus aiiud.

XXX. Id adeo sic cognoscite. Quis tum auderet dicere
nocentem condemnatum esse Oppianicum ? quis nunc audet
negare ? Quis tum pos^et arguere ab Oppianico temptatum
esse iudicium pecunia ? quis id hoc tempore infitiari potest ? 20
Cui tum liceret docere Oppianicum reum factum esse tum deni-
que, cum duobus proximis praeiudiciis condemnatus esset ?
quis est qui id hoc tempore infirmare conetur ? 81. Quare
invidia remota, quam dies mitigavit, oratio mea deprecata
est, vestra fides atque aequitas a veritatis disceptatione reiecit, 25
quid est praeterea quod in causa relinquatur ?

Versatam esse in iudicio pecuniam constat : ea quaeritur
unde profecta sit, ab accusatore an ab reo. Dicit accusator
haec : &apos; Primum gravissimis criminibus accusabam, ut nihil
opus esset pecunia : deinde condemnatum adducebam, ut ne 30
eripi quidem pecunia posset : postremo, etiamsi absolutus
fuisset, mearum tamen omnium fortunarum status incokmiis
maneret.&apos; Quid contra reus ? &apos; Primum ipsam multitudinem

32 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xxx. 82

criminum et atrocitatem pertimescebam : deinde Fabriciis
propter conscientiam mei sceleris condemnatis me esse con-
demnatum sentiebam : postremo in eum casum veneram, ut
omnis mearum fortunarum status unius iudicii periculo con-
5 tineretur.&apos;

82. Age, quoniam corrumpendi iudicii causas ille multas
et graves habuit, hic nullam, profectio ipsius pecuniae requir-
atur. Confecit tabulas dihgentissime Cluentius. Haec autem
res habet hoc certe, ut nihil possit neque additum neque

10 detractum de re famihari latere. Anni sunt octo, cum ista
causa in ista meditatione versatur, cum omnia, quae ad eam
rem pertinent, et ex huius et ex ahorum tabuhs agitatis,
tractatis, inquiritis : cum interea Cluentianae pecuniae vesti-
gium nullum invenitis. Quid, Albiana pecuni^ vestigiisne

15 nobis odoranda est an ad ipsum cubile vobis indicibus venire
possumus ? Tenentur uno in loco HS i5cxl : tenentur apud
hominem audacissimum : tenentur apud iudicem. SS- Quid
voltis amphus ? At enim Staienus non fuit ab Oppianico, sed
a Cluentio ad iudicium corrumpendum constitutus. Cur

20 eum, cum in consilium iretur, Cluentius et Cannutius abesse
patiebantur? cur cum in consihum mittebant, Staienum
iudicem qui pecuniam dederant non requirebant ? Oppianicus
querebatur : Quinctius flagitabat : sine Staieno ne in consilium
iretur, tribunicia potestate effectum est. At condemnavit.

25 Hanc enim condemnationem dederat obsidem Bulbo et ceteris,
ut destitutus ab Oppianico videretur. Quare si istinc causa
corrumpendi iudicii, si istinc pecunia, istinc Staienus, istinc
denique omnis fraus et audacia est, hinc pudor, honesta vita,
nulla suspicio pecuniae, nuUa corrumpendi iudicii causa,

30 patimini veritate patefacta atque omni errore sublato eo transire
ihius turpitudinis infamiam, ubi cetera maleficia consistunt :
ab eo invidiam discedere ahquando, ad quem numquam
accessisse culpam videtis.

xxxiT. 8;] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 33

XXXI. 84. At enim pecuniam Staieno dedit Oppianicus
non ad corrumpendum iudicium, sed ad conciliationem gra-
tiae. Tene hoc, Acci, dicere, tali prudentia, etiam usu atque
exercitatione praeditum? Sapientissimum esse dicunt eum,
cui quod opus sit ipsi veniat in mentem : proxime accedere 5
illum, qui alterius bene inventis obtemperet. In stultitia con-
tra est. Minus enim stultus est is, cui nihil in mentem venit,
quam ille, qui, quod stulte alteri venit in mentem, comprobat.
Istam conciliationem gratiae Staienus tum recenti re, cum
faucibus premeretur, excogitavit, sive, ut homines tum loque- 10
bantur, a P. Cethego admonitus. 85. Nam fuisse hunc
tum hominum sermonem recordari potestis : Cethegum,
quod hominem odisset et quod eius improbitatem versari
in re pubUca nollet et quod videret eum, qui se ab reo
pecuniam, cum iudex esset, clam atque extra ordinem 15
accepisse confessus esset, salvum esse non posse, minus ei
fidele consilium dedisse. In hoc si improbus Cethegus fuit,
videtur mihi adversarium removere voluisse. Sin erat eius
modi causa, ut Staienus nummos se accepisse negare non
posset, nihil autem erat periculosius nec turpius quam ad 20
quam rem accepisset confiteri, non est consiHum Cethegi
reprehendendum. 86. Verum aUa causa tum Staieni fuit, alia
nunc, Acci, tua est. Ille cum re premeretur, quodcumque
diceret, honestius diceret, quam si, quod erat factum, fateretur :
te vero illud idem, quod tum explosum et eiectum est, nunc 25
rettulisse demiror. Qui enim poterat tum in gratiam redire

um Oppianico Cluentius? qui cum matre? Haerebat in
.bulis pubUcis reus et accusator : condemnati erant Fabricii :
lec elabi aUo accusatore poterat Albius nec sine ignominia
:alumniae reUnquere accusationem Cluentius. 30

XXXII. 87. An ut praevaricaretur ? lam id quoque ad
corrumpendum iudicium pertinet. Sed quid opus erat ad

res per Staienum potius, hominem ab utroque alienissimum,
sordidissimum, turpissimum, quam per bonuni aliquem virum
ageretur et amicum necessariumque communem ? Sed quid
ego haec pluribus quasi de re obscura disputo, cum ipsa
5 pecunia, quae Staieno data est, numero ac summa sua non
modo quanta fuerit, sed etiam ad quam rem fuerit ostendat ?
Sedecim dico iudices, ut Oppianicus absolveretur, corrum-
pendos fuisse : ad Staienum sescenta quadraginta milia num-
mum esse delata. Si, ut tu dicis, gratiae conciHandae causa,

TO quadraginta istorum accessio miHum quid valet? si, ut nos
dicimus, ut quadragena milia sedecim iudicibus darentur, non
Archimedes melius potuit discribere.

88. At enim iudicia facta permulta sunt, a Cluentio iudicium
esse corruptum. Immo vero ante hoc tempus omnino ista

15 ipsa res suo nomine in iudicium numquam est vocata. Ita
multum agitata, ita diu iactata [ista res] est, ut hodierno die
primum causa illa defensa sit, hodierno die primum veritas
vocem contra invidiam his iudicibus freta miserit. Verum
tamen ista multa iudicia quae sunt ? Ego enim me ad omnia

20 confirmavi et sic paravi, ut docerem, quae facta postea iudicia
de illo iudicio dicer^ntur, partim ruinae simiHora aut tempestati
quam iudicio et disceptationi fuisse, partim nihil contra
Habitum valere, partim etiam pro hoc esse, partim esse eius
modi, ut neque appellata umquam iudicia sint neque

25 existimata. 89. Hic ego magis ut consuetudinem servem,
quam quod vos non vestra hoc sponte faciatis, petam a vobis,
ut me, dum de his singulis disputo iudiciis, attente audiatis.

XXXIII. Condemnatus est C. lunius, qui ei quaestioni

Quo tempore illum a quaestione ad nullum aHud rei pubHcae

abreptus est. At ad quam quaestionem ? Voltus enim vestri,
iudices, me invitant, ut, quae reticenda putaram, libeat iam
libere dicere. 90. Quid ? illa tandem quaestio aut disceptatio
aut iudicium fuit ? Putabo fuisse. Dicat qui vult hodie de illo
populo concitato, cui tum populo mos gestus est, qua de re 5
lunius causam dixerit : quemcumque rogaveris, hoc respon-
debit : quod pecuniam acceperit, quod innocentem cir-
cumvenerit. Est haec opinio. At, si ita esset, hac lege
accusatum oportuit, qua accusatur Habitus. At ipse ea [lege]
quaerebat. Paucos dies exspectasset Quinctius. At neque 10
privatus accusare nec sedata invidia volebat. Videtis igitur
non in causa, sed in tempore ac potestate spem omnem
accusatoris fuisse. 91. Multam petivit. Qua lege ? quod in
legem non iurasset, quae res nemini umquam fraudi fuit,
et quod C. Verres, praetor urbanus, homo sanctus et diHgens, 15
subsortitionem eius in eo codice non haberet, qui tum interlitus
proferebatur. His de causis C. lunius condemnatus est,
iudices, levissimis et infirmissimis, quas omnino in iudicium
adferri non oportuit. Itaque oppressus est, non causa, sed
tempore. 20

XXXIV. 92. Hoc vos Chientio iudicium putatis obesse

oportere ? Quam ob causam ? Si ex lege subsortitus non erat

luni.us aut si in ahquam legem ahquando non iuraverat,

audiatur tanto silentio, tum lunio defendendi sui potestas
erepta sit? Quia tum in causa nihil erat praeter invidiam,
errorem, suspicionem, contiones cotidianas seditiose ac popu-
lariter concitatas. Accusabat tribunus plebis idem in con-
5 tionibus, idem ad subsellia : ad iudicium non modo de con-
tione, sed etiam cum ipsa contione veniebat. Gradus illi
Aurelii tum novi quasi pro theatro illi iudicio aedificati vide-
bantur : quos ubi accusator concitatis hominibus complerat,
non modo dicendi ab reo, sed ne surgendi quidem potestas

10 erat. 94. Nuper apud C. Orchivium, collegam meum, locus
ab iudicibus Fausto Sullae de pecuniis residuis non est
constitutus, non quo illi aut exlegem esse Sullam aut causam
pecuniae publicae contemptam atque abiectam putarent, sed
quod accusante tribuno plebis condicione aequa disceptari

15 posse non putarunt. Quid conferam ? Sullamne cum lunio?
an hunc tribunum plebis cum Quinctio ? an vero tempus cum
tempore? Sulla maximis opibus, cognatis, adfinibus, neces-
sariis, clientibus plurimis : haec autem apud lunium parva et
infirma et ipsius labore quaesita atque coUecta. Hic tribunus

20 plebis modestus, pudens, non modo non seditiosus, sed etiam
seditiosis adversarius : ille autem acerbus, crimiriosus, popularis
homo ac turbulentus. Tempus hoc tranquillum atque
placatum : illud omnibus invidiae tempestatibus concitatum.
Quae cum ita essent, in Fausto tamen illi iudices statuerunt,

25 iniqua condicione reum causam dicere, cum adversario eius
ad ius accusationis summa vis potestatis accederet.

XXXV. 95. Quam quidem rationem vos, iudices, dihgenter
pro vestra sapientia [et humanitate] cogitare et penitus per-
spicere debetis, quid mali, quantum pericuH uni cuique

30 nostrum inferre possit vis tribunicia, conflata praesertim
invidia et contionibus seditiose concitatis. Optimis hercule
temporibus, tum, cum homines se non iactatione populari,
sed dignitate atque innocentia tuebantur, tamen nec P.

XXXVI. 98] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 37

Popilius neque Q. Metellus, clarissimi viri atque amplissimi,
vim tribuniciam sustinere potuerunt : ne^um his temporibus,
his moribus, his magistratibus, sine vestra sapientia ac sine
iudiciorum remediis salvi esse possimus. 96. Non fuit illud
igitur iudicium iudicii simile, iudices, non fuit, in quo non 5
modus ullus est adhibitus, non mos consuetudoque servata,
non causa defensa : vis illa fuit et, ut saepe iam dixi, ruina
quaedam atque tempestas et quidvis potius quam iudicium
aut disceptatio aut quaestio. Quod si quis est qui illud iudi-
cium fuisse arbitretur et qui his rebus iudicatis standum 10
putet, is tamen hanc causam ab illa debet seiungere. Ab illo
enim, sive quod in legem non iurasset sive quod e lege sub-
sortitus iudicem non esset, multa petita esse dicitur. Cluen-
ti autem ratio cum ilHs legibus, quibus a lunio multa petita
est, nulla potest ex parte esse coniuncta. 97. At enim etiam 1 5
Bulbus est condemnatus. Adde maiestatis, ut intellegas hoc
iudicium cum illo non esse coniunctum. At est hoc illi
crimen obiectum. Fateor, sed etiam legionem esse ab eo
soUicitatam in Illyrico C. Cosconi Htteris et multorum testi-
moniis planum factum est : quod crimen erat proprium illius 20
quaestionis et quae res lege maiestatis tenebatur. At hoc
obfuit ei maxime. lam ista divinatio est : qua si uti licet,
vide ne mea coniectura multo sit verior. Ego enim sic
arbitror, Bulbum, quod homo nequam, turpis, improbus, mul-
tis flagitiis contaminatus in iudicium sit adductus, idcirco 25
facilius esse damnatum. Tu mihi ex tota causa Bulbi,
quod tibi commodum est, ehgis, ut id esse secutos iudices
dicas.

XXXVI. 98. Quapropter hoc Bulbi iudicium non plus huic
obesse causae debet quam illa, quae commemorata sunt ab 30
accusatore, duo iudicia, P. Popili et Ti. Guttae, qui causam
de ambitu dixerunt, qui accusati sunt ab eis, qui erant ipsi
ambitus condemnati : quos ego non idcirco esse arbitror in

38 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xxxvi. 99

integrum restitutos, quod planum fecerint illos ob rem iudi-
candam pecuniam accepisse, sed quod iudicibus probaverint,
cum in eodem genere, in quo ipsi otfendissent, alios reprehen-
dissent, se ad praemia legis venire oportere. Quapropter
5 neminem dubitare existimo quin illa damnatio ambitus nulla
ex parte cum causa Cluenti vestroque iudicio coniuncta esse
possit. 99. Quid, quod Staienus est condemnatus? Non
dico hoc tempore, iudices, id quod nescio an dici oporteat,
iUum maiestatis esse condemnatum : non recito testimonia

10 hominum honestissimorum, quae in Staienum sunt dicta ab
eis, qui Mam. AemiUo, clarissimo viro, legati et praefecti et
tribuni mihtares fuerunt : quorum testimoniis planum factum
est maxime eius opera, cum quaestor esset, in exercitu
seditionem esse conflatam. Ne illa quidem testimonia recito,

15 quae dicta sunt, de HS T5c, quae ille cum accepisset nomine
iudicii Safiniani, sicut in Oppianici iudicio postea, reticuit
atque suppressit. lOO. Omitto et haec et aUa permulta, quae
illo iudicio in Staienum dicta sunt : hoc dico, eandem tum
fuisse P. et L. Cominiis, equitibus Romanis, honestis homin-

20 ibus et disertis, controversiam cum Staieno, quem accusabant,
quae nunc mihi est cum Accio. Cominii dicebant idem,
quod ego dico : Staienum ab Oppianico pecuniam accepisse,
ut iudicium corrumperet : Staienus conciUandae gratiae causa
accepisse dicebat. lOI. Irridebatur haec iUius reconciUatio

25 et persona viri boni suscepta, sicut in statuis inauratis, quas
posuit ad luturnae : quibus subscripsit reges a se in gratiam
esse reductos. Exagitabantur eius omnes fraudes atque
faUaciae, tota vita in eius modi ratione versata aperiebatur,
egestas domestica, quaestus forensis in medium proferebatur,

30 nummarius interpres pacis et concordiae non probabatur.
Itaque tum Staienus, cum idem defenderet quod Accius,
condemnatus est. 102. Cominii cum hoc agerent, quod nos
in tota causa egimus, probaverunt. Quam ob rem si Staieni

■

XXXVII. 104] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 39

damnatione Oppianicum iudicium corrumpere voluisse,
Oppianicum iudici ad emendas sententias dedisse pecuniam
iudicatum est : cum ita constitutum sit, ut in illa culpa aut
Cluentius sit aut Oppianicus, Cluenti nummus nuUus iudici
datus ullo vestigio reperietur, Oppianici pecunia post iudicium 5
factum ab iudice ablata est : potest esse dubium, quin illa
damnatio Staieni non modo non sit contra Cluentium, sed
maxime nostram causam defensionemque confirmet ?

XXXVI I. 103. Ergo adjiuc luni iudicium video esse eius
modi, ut incursionem potius seditionis, vim multitudinis, 10
impetum tribunicium, quam iudicium appellandum putem.
Quod si qui illud iudicium appellet, tamen hoc confiteatur
necesse est, nuUo modo illam multam, quae ab lunio petita
sit, cum Cluenti causa posse coniungi. Illud igitur lunianum
per vim factum est, Bulbi et Popili et Guttae contra Cluentium 1 5
non est : Staieni etiam pro Cluentio est. Videamus ecquod
aliud iudicium, quod pro Cluentio sit, proferre possimus.

Dixitne tandem causam C. Fidiculanius Falcula, qui
Oppianicum condemnarat, cum praesertim, id quod fuit in
illo iudicio invidiosissimum, paucos dies ex subsortitione 20
sedisset ? Dixit et bis quidem dixit. In summam enim L.
Quinctius invidiam contionibus eum cotidianis seditiosis et
turbulentis adduxerat. Uno iudicio multa est ab eo petita,
sicut ab lunio, quod non suae decuriae munere neque ex lege
sedisset. Paulo sedatiore tempore est accusatus, quam 25
unius, sed eadem fere lege et crimine. Quia nuUa in iudicio
editio neque vis nec turba versata est, prima actione facillime
st absolutus. Non numero hanc absolutionem. Nihilo
inus enim potest, ut illam multam non commiserit, accepisse
tamen ob rem iudicandam. *Causam nusquam Staienus ea 30
de re lege dixit. Proprium crimen illud quaestionis eius non
fuit. 104. Fidiculanius quid fecisse dicebatur? accepisse a
Cluentio HS cccc. Cuius erat ordinis ? senatorii. Qua lege in

40 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xxxviii. 105

eo genere a senatore ratio repeti solet, de pecuniis repetundis,
ea lege accusatus honestissime est absolutus. Acta est enim
causa more maiorum, sine vi, sine metu, sine periculo : dicta
et exposita et demonstrata sunt omnia. Adducti iudices sunt
5 non modo potuisse honeste ab eo reum condemnari, qui non
perpetuo sedisset, sed, aliud si is iudex nihil scisset, nisi quae
praeiudicia de eo facta esse constarent, audire praeterea nihil
debuisse.

XXXVIII. 105. Tum etiam ilH quinque, qui, imperitorum

10 hominum rumusculos aucupati tum illum absolverunt, iam
suam clementiam laudari magno opere nolebant, a quibus si
qui quaereret sedissentne iudices in C. Fabricium, sedisse se
dicerent : si interrogarentur num quo crimine is esset accusatus
praeterquam veneni eius, quod quaesitum Habito diceretur,

1 5 negarent : si deinde essent rogati quid iudicassent, condem-
nasse se dicerent : nemo enim absolvit. Eodem modo
quaesitum si esset de Scamandro, certe idem respondissent :
tametsi ille una sententia est absolutus, sed illam unam nemo
tum istorum suam dici vellet. 106. Uter igitur faciHus suae

20 sententiae rationem redderet : isne, qui se et sibi et rei iudi-
catae constitisse dicit, an ille, qui se in principem maleficii
lenem, in adiutores eius et conscios vehementissimum esse
respondet ? Quorum ego de sententia non debeo disputare :
neque enim dubito quin tales viri suspicione ahqua perculsi

25 repentina de statu suo dechnarint. Quare eorum, qui
absolverunt, misericordiam non reprehendo, eorum, qui in
iudicando superiora iudicia secuti sunt sua sponte, non
Staieni fraude, constantiam comprobo, eorum vero, qui sibi
non Hquere dixerunt, sapientiam laudo, qui absolvere eum,

30 quem nocentissimum cognorant, et quem ipsi bis antea
condemnarant, nuUo modo poterant : condemnare, cum tanta
consihi infamia et tam atrocis rei suspicio esset iniecta, Eaulo
posterius patefacta re makierunt. I07- Ac ne ex facto solum

sapientes illos iudicetis, sed etiam ex hominibus ipsis quod hi
fecerunt, rectissime ac sapientissime factum probetis, quis P.
Octavio Balbo ingenio prudentior, iure peritior, fide, reUgione,
officio diUgentior aut sanctior commemorari potest? Non
absolvit. Quis Q. Considio constantior? quis iudiciorum 5
atque eius dignitatis, quae in iudiciis pubhcis versari debet,
peritior ? quis virtute, consiho, auctoritate praestantior ? Ne
is quidem absolvit. Longum est de singulorum virtute [ita]
dicere : quae, quia cognita est ab omnibus, verborum orna-
menta non quaerit. Quahs vir M. luventius Pedo fuit ex 10
vetere iha iudicum disciphna ? quahs L. Cauhus Mergus ? M.
Basilus ? C. Caudinus ? qui omnes in iudiciis pubhcis iam tum,
florente re pubhca, floruerunt. Ex eodem numero L. Cassius,
Cn. Heius, pari et integritate et prudentia : quorum nuhius
sententia est Oppianicus absolutus. Atque in his omnibus 15
natu minimus, ingenio et dihgentia et religione par eis, quos
antea commemoravi, P. Saturius, in eadem sententia fuit.
108. O innocentiam Oppianici singularem ! quo in reo, qui
absolvit ambitiosus, qui distuht cautus, qui condemnavit con-
stans existimatur. 20

XXXIX. Haec tum agente Quinctio neque in contione
neque in iudicio demonstrata sunt. Neque enim ipse dici
patiebatur nec per multitudinem concitatam consistere cui-
quam in dicendo hcebat. Itaque ipse postquam lunium per-
vertit, totam causam rehquit. Paucis enim diebus iUis et ipse 25
privatus est factus et hominum studia defervisse intehegebat.
Quod si per quos dies lunium accusavit Fidiculanium accu-
sare voluisset, respondendi Fidiculanio potestas facta non
esset. Ac primo quidem omnibus ihis iudicibus, qui Oppia-
nicum condemnarant, minabatur. 109. lam insolentiam 3°
noratis hominis : noratis animos eius ac spiritus tribunicios.
Quod erat odium, di immortales ! quae superbia ! quanta igno-
ratio sui ! (|uam grayis atque intolerabihs adrogantia ! (jui

42 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [XL. iio

illud iam ipsum acerbe tulerit, ex quo illa nata sunt omnia,
non sibi ac defensioni suae condonatum esse Oppianicum :
proinde quasi non satis signi esse debuerit ab omnibus eum
fuisse desertum, qui se ad patronum illum contulisset. Erat
5 enim Romae summa copia patronorum, hominum eloquen-
tissimorum atque amplissimorum, quorum certe aliquis de-
fendisset equitem Romanum, in municipio suo nobilem, si
honeste putasset eius modi causam posse defendi.

XL. IIO. Nam Quinctius quidem quam causam umquam an-

lo tea dixerat, cum annos ad quinquaginta natus esset? quis eum
umquam non modo in patroni, sed in laudatoris aut advocati
loco viderat ? qui quod Rostra iam diu vacua locumque illum
post adventum L. SuUae a tribunicia voce desertum oppresser-
at, multitudinemque desuefactam iam a contionibus ad veteris

15 consuetudinis similitudinem revocarat, idcirco cuidam homi-
num generi pauUsper iucundior fuit. Atque idem quanto in
odio postea suis ipsis fuit, per quos in altiorem locum ascend-
erat! neque iniuria. III. Facite enim ut non solum mores
et adrogantiam eius, sed etiam voltum atque amictum atque

20 etiam illam usque ad talos demissam purpuram recordemini.
Is, quasi non esset uUo modo ferendum se ex iudicio dis-
cessisse victum, rem a subselUis ad Rostra detuUt. Et iam
querimur saepe hominibus novis non satis magnos in hac civi-
tate esse fructus ? Nego usquam umquam fuisse maiores, ubi si

25 quis ignobiUloco natus ita vivit, ut nobiUtatis dignitatem virtute
tueri posse videatur, usque eo pervenit, quoad eum industria
cum innocentia prosecuta est. 112. Si quis autem hoc uno
nititur, quod sit ignobilis, procedit saepe longius, quam si
idem iUe esset cum isdem suis vitiis nobiUssimus. Ut Quinctius

30 — nihil enim dicam de ceteris — si fuisset homo nobiUs, quis
eum cum iUa superbia atque intolerantia ferre potuisset?

iQuod eo loco fuit, ita tulerunt, ut, si quid haberet a natura
boni, prodesse ei putarent oportere : superbiam autem atque

XLi. 115] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 43

adrogantiam eius deridendam magis arbitrarentur propter
humilitatem hominis quam pertimescendam.

XLI. Sed, ut ilkic revertar, quo tempore Fidiculanius abso-
lutus est, tu, qui iudicia facta commemoras, quaero, quid tum
esse existimas iudicatum? certe gratis iudicasse. II3. At 5
condemnarat : at causam totam non audierat : at in contioni-
bus a L. Quinctio vehementer erat et saepe vexatus. Illa
igitur omnia Quinctiana iniqua, falsa, turbulenta, popularia,
seditiosa iudicia fuerunt. Esto : potuit esse innocens Falcula.
lam ergo aUqui Oppianicum gratis condemnavit : iam non 10
eos lunius subsortitus est, qui pecunia accepta condemnarent :
iam putabitur aHqui ab initio non sedisse et tamen Oppiani-
cum gratis condemnasse. Verum, si innocens Falcula,
quaero qui sit nocens? si hic gratis condemnavit, quis
accepit? Nego rem esse ullam cuiquam illorum obiectam, 15
quae Fidiculanio non obiecta sit, ahquid fuisse in Fidiculani
causa, quod idem non esset in ceterorum. II4. Aut hoc
iudicium reprehendas tu, cuius accusatio rebus iudicatis niteba-
tur, necesse est, aut, si hoc verum esse concedis, Oppianicum
gratis condemnatum esse fateare. 20

Quamquam satis magno argumento esse debet, quod ex
tam multis iudicibus absoluto Falcula nemo reus factus est.
Quid enim mihi damnatos ambitus colligitis, aha lege, certis
criminibus, plurimis testibus? cum primum ilU ipsi debuerint
potius accusari de pecuniis repetundis quam ambitus. Nam 25
si in ambitus iudiciis hoc eis obfuit, cum aUa lege causam
dicerent, certe, si propria lege huius peccati adducti essent,
multo plus obfuisset. 115. Deinde si tanta vis fuit istius cri-
minis, ut, qua quisque lege ex iUis iudicibus reus factus esset,
tamen hac plaga periret, cur in tanta muUitudine accu- 3°
satorum, tantis praemiis, ceteri rei facti non sunt ? Hic pro-
fertur id, quod iudicium appeUari non oportet, P. Septimio
Scaevolae Utem eo nomine esse aestimatam. Cuius rei quae

44 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [XLI. ii6

consuetudo sit, quoniam apud homines peritissimos dico,
pluribus verbis docere non debeo. Numquam enim ea dili-
gentia, quae solet adhiberi in ceteris iudiciis, eadem reo
damnato adhibita est. Il6. In Htibus aestimandis fere iudi-
5 ces aut, quod sibi eum, quem semel condemnarunt, inimi-
cum putant esse, si quae in eum lis capitis illata est, non
admittunt, aut, quod se perfunctos iam esse arbitrantur, cum
de reo iudicarunt, neglegentius attendunt cetera. Itaque et
maiestatis absoluti sunt permulti, quibus damnatis de pecu-

i o niis repetundis htes maiestatis essent aestimatae, et hoc co-
tidie fieri videmus, ut reo damnato de pecuniis repetundis,
ad quos pervenisse pecunias in Htibus aestimandis statutum
sit, eos idem iudices absolvant : quod cum fit, non iudicia
rescinduntur, sed hoc statuitur, aestimationem htium non

1 5 esse iudicium. Scaevola condemnatus est aUis criminibus,
frequentissimis ApuHae testibus. Omni contentione pugna-
tum est. uti hs haec capitis aestimaretur. Quae res si rei
iudicatae pondus habuisset, ille postea vel isdem vel aUis
inimicis reus hac lege ipsa factus esset. ^

2o XLII. 117. Sequitur id, quod illi iudicium appellant, ma-
iores autem nostri numquam neque iudicium nominarunt ne-
que proinde ut rem iudicatam observarunt, animadversionem
atque auctoritatem censoriam. Qua de re ante quam dicere
incipio, perpauca mihi de meo ofiicio verba faciunda sunt,

25 ut a me cum huiusce pericuU tum ceterorum quoque offi-
ciorum et amicitiarum ratio conservata esse videatur. Nam
mihi cum viris fortibus, qui censores proxime fuerunt, am-
bobus est amicitia, cum altero vero, sicuti plerique vestrum
sciunt, magnus usus et summa utriusque officiis constituta

30 necessitudo. Il8. Quare quicquid de subscriptionibus
eorum mihi dicendum erit, eo dicam animo, ut omnem ora-
tionem meam non de illorum facto, sed de ratione censoria
habitam existimari vehm : a Lentulo autem, famihari meo, qui

XLiii. 120] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 45

a me pro eximia sua virtute summisque honoribus, quos a
populo Romano adeptus est, honoris causa nominatur, facile
hoc, iudices, impetrabo, ut, quam ipse adhibere consuevit
in amicorum pericuhs cum fidem et dihgentiam tum vim
animi hbertatemque dicendi^ ex hac mihi concedat ut tantum . 5
mihi sumam, quantum sine huius periculo praeterire non pos-
sim. A me tamen, ut aequum est, omnia caute pedetemptim-
que dicentur, ut neque fides huius defensionis rehcta neque
cuiusquam aut dignitas laesa aut amicitia violata esse videatur.

119. Video igitur, iudices, animadvertisse censores in 10
iudices quosdam ilhus consihi luniani, cum istam ipsam
causam subscriberent. Hic iUud primum commune propo-
nam, numquam animadversionibus censoriis hanc civitatem
ita contentam ut rebus iudicatis fuisse. Neque in re nota
^ (^ consumam tempus. Exemph causa ponam unum ihud : C. 15
^ &apos; &apos;^ Getam, cum a L. Meteho et Cn. Domitio censoribus ex sen-
atu eiectus esset, censorem esse ipsum postea factum : et cuius
mores erant a censoribus reprehensi, hunc postea et popuh
Romani et eorum, qui in ipsum animadverterant, moribus
praefuisse. Quod si ihud iudicium putaretur, ut ceteri turpi- 20
iudicio damnati in perpetuum omni honore ac dignitate pri-
vantur, sic hominibus ignominia notatis neque ad honorem
aditus neque in curiam reditus esset. 120. Nunc si quem Cn.
Lentuh aut L. Gehi hbertus furti condemnarit, is omnibus
ornamentis amissis numquam uham honestatis suae partem 25
reciperabit : quos autem ipse L. Gehius et Cn. Lentulus, duo
censores, clarissimi viri sapientissimique homines, furti et
captarum pecuniarum nomine notaverunt, ei non modo in
senatum redierunt, sed etiam iharum ipsarum rerum iudiciis
absoluti sunt. &quot; 30

XLIII. Neminem voluerunt maiores nostri non modo de
existimatione cuiusquam, sed ne pecuniaria quidem de re
minima esse iudicem, nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset.

46 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [XLiii. 121

Quapropter in omnibus legibus, quibus exceptum est, de
quibus causis aut magistratum capere non liceat aut iudicem
legi aut alterum accusare, haec ignominiae causa praetermissa
est. Timoris enim causam, non vitae poenam in illa potes-
5 tate esse voluerunt. 121. Itaque non solum illud ostendam,
quod iam videtis, populi Romani suffragiis saepe numero
censorias subscriptiones esse sublatas, verum etiam iudiciis
eorum, qui iurati statuere maiore cum religione et diligentia
debuerunt. Primum iudices, senatores equitesque Romani

10 in compluribus iam reis, quos contra leges pecunias accepisse
subscriptum est, suae potius religioni quam censorum opinioni
paruerunt. Deinde praetores urbani, qui iurati debent opti-
mum quemque in lectos iudices referre, sibi nunquam ad eam
rem censoriam ignominiam impedimento esse oportere dux-

T 5 erunt. 122. Censores denigue ipsi saepe numero superiorum
censorum iudiciis, si ista iudicia appellare voltis, non steterunt.
Atque etiam ipsi inter se censores sua iudicia tanti esse arbi-
trantur, ut alter alterius iudicium non modo reprehendat, sed
etiam rescindat : ut alter de senatu movere veHt, alter retineat

20 et ordine amplissimo dignum existimet : ut alter in aerarios
referre aut tribu movere iubeat, alter vetet. Quare qui vobis
in mentem venit haec appellare iudicia, quae a populo rescindi,
ab iuratis iudicibus repudiari, a magistratibus neglegi, ab eis,
qui eandem potestatem adepti sunt, commutari, inter collegas

25 discrepare videatis?

XLIV. 123. Quae cum ita sint, videamus quid tandem
censores de illo iudicio corrupto iudicasse dicantur. Ac pri-
mum illud statuamus, utrum quia censores subscripserint
ita sit, an, quia ita fuerit, illi subscripserint. Si quia sub-

30 scripserint, videte quid agatis, ne in unum quemque nostrum
censoribus in posterum potestatem regiam permittatis : ne
subscriptio censoria non minus calamitatis civibus quam illa
acerbissima proscriptio possit adferre : ne censorium stilum.

cuius mucronem multis remediis maiores nostri rettuder-
unt, aeque posthac atque illum dictatorium pertimescamus.
124. Sin autem, quod subscriptum est, quia verum est, id-
circo grave debet esse, hoc quaeramus, verum sit an falsum :
removeantur auctoritates censoriae : tollatur id ex causa, quod 5
in causa non est : doce quam pecuniam Cluentius dederit,unde
dederit, quem ad modum dederit : unum denique a Cluentio
profectae pecuniae vestigium ostende. Vince deinde bonum
virum fuisse Oppianicum, hominem integrum, nihil de illo
umquam secus esse existimatum, nihil denique praeiudicatum. 10
Tum auctoritatem censoriam amplexato : tum illorum iudicium
coniunctum cum re esse defendito. 125. Dum vero eum
fuisse Oppianicum constabit, qui tabulas pubHcas municipii
manu sua corrupisse iudicatus sit, qui testamentum interleverit,
qui supposita persona falsum testamentum obsignandum 15
curaverit, qui eum, cuius nomine id obsignatum est, inter-
fecerit, qui avunculum fiHi sui in servitute ac vinculis necaverit,
qui municipes suos proscribendos occidendosque curaverit, qui
eius uxorem, quem occiderat, in matrimonium duxerit, qui
pecuniam pro abortione dederit, qui socrum, qui uxores, qui 20
uno tempore fratris uxorem speratosque hberos fratremque
ipsum, qui denique suos liberos interfecerit, qui cum venenum
privigno suo dare vellet, manifesto deprehensus sit, cuius
ministris consciisque damnatis ipse adductus in iudicium
pecuniam iudici dederit ad sententias iudicum corrumpendas : 25
dum haec, inquam, de Oppianico constabunt, neque uUo
argumento Cluentianae pecuniae crimen tenebitur, quid est
quod te ista censoria, sive voluntas sive opinio fuit, adiuvare
aut hunc innocentem opprimere posse videatur ?

scripserunt. Cum enim in homine nulla culpa inveniretur,

10 quid ille meruisset, non quid de eo statutum esset quaerendum
esse duxerunt. 127. Nam haec quidem, quae de iudicio
corrupto subscripserunt, quis est qui ab ilHs satis cognita et
diHgenter iudicata arbitretur? In M&apos;. Aquilium et in Ti.

suspicione ponendi : duos solos video auctoritate censorum

20 adfines ei turpitudini iudicari. Aut illud adferant, aliquid
sese, quod de his duobus habuerint compertum, de ceteris
non comperisse.

XLVI. 128. Nam illud quidem minime probandum est, ad
notationes auctoritatemque censoriam exemplum illos e con-

25 suetudine miUtari transtulisse. Statuerunt enim ita maiores
nostri, ut, si a multis esset flagitium rei militaris admissum,
sortito in quosdam animadverteretur, ut metus videHcet ad
omnes, poena ad paucos perveniret. Quod idem facere
censores in delectu dignitatis et in iudicio civium et in

30 animadversione vitiorum qui convenit ? Nam miles, qui locum
non tenuit, qui hostium impetum vimque pertimuit, potest
idem postea et miles esse meHor et vir bonus et civis utilis.
Quare qui in bello propter hostium metum deHquerat, ampHor

ei mortis et supplicii metus est a maioribus constitutus : ne
autem nimium multi poenam capitis subirent, idcirco illa
sortitio comparata est. 129. Hoc tu idem facies censor in
senatu legendo? Si erunt plures, qui ob innocentem con-
demnandum pecuniam acceperint, tu non animadvertes in 5
omnes, sed carpes, ut velis, et paucos ex multis ad ignominiam
sortiere ? Habebit igitur te sciente et vidente curia senatorem,
populus Romanus iudicem, res publica civem sine ignominia
quemquam, qui ad perniciem innocentis fidem suam et reli-
gioneni pecunia commutarit ? et, qui pretio adductus eripuerit i o
patriam, fortunas, liberos civi innocenti, is censoriae severitatis
nota non inuretur? Tu es praefectus moribus, tu magister
veteris disciplinae ac severitatis, si aut retines quemquam
sciens in senatu scelere tanto contaminatum aut statuis, qui
in eadem culpa sit, non eadem poena adfici convenire ? Aut 1 5
quam condicionem supplicii maiores in bello timiditati militis
propositam esse voluerunt, eandem tu in pace constitues im-
probitati senatoris ? Quod si hoc exemplum ex re militari ad
animadversionem censoriam transferendum fuit, §ortitione
id ipsum factum esse oportuit. Sin autem sortiri ad poenam 20
et hominum dehctum fortunae iudicio committere minime
censorium est, certe in multorum peccato carpi paucos ad
ignominiam non oportet.

XLVII. 130. Verum omnes intellegimus in istis sub-
scriptionibus ventum quendam popularem esse quaesitum. 25
lactata res erat in contione : incognita causa probatum erat
illud multitudini : nemini Hcitum est contra dicere : nemo
denique, ut defenderet contrariam partem, laborabat. In
invidiam porro magnam illa iudicia venerant. Etenim paucis
postea mensibus aHa vehemens erat in iudiciis ex notatione 30
tabellarum invidia versata. Praetermitti ab censoribus et
neglegi macula iudiciorum posse non videbatur. Homines,
quos ceteris vitiis atque omni dedecore infames videbant, eos

D

50 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [XLVii. 131

hac quoque subscriptione notare voluerunt, et eo magis, quod
illo ipso tempore illis censoribus erant iudicia cum equestri
ordine communicata, ut viderentur per hominum idoneo-
rum ignominiam sua auctoritate illa iudicia reprehendisse.
5 131. Quod si hanc apud eosdem ipsos censores mihi aut
ahi causam agere hcuisset, hominibus taH prudentia praeditis
certe probavissem : res enim indicat nihil ipsos habuisse
cogniti, nihil comperti : ex tota ista subscriptione rumorem
quendam et plausum popularem esse quaesitum. Nam in

10 P. PopiHum, qui Oppianicum condemnarat, subscripsit L.
GelHus, quod is pecuniam accepisset, quo innocentem
condemnaret. lam id ipsum quantae divinationis est scire
innocentem fuisse reum, quem fortasse numquam viderat,
cum homines sapientissimi, iudices, ut nihil dicam de eis,&quot;

15 qui condemnarunt, causa cognita sibi dixerunt non Hquere !

132. Verum esto : condemnat PopiHum GeUius : iudicat

accepisse a Cluentio pecuniam. Negat hoc Lentulus. Nam

PopiHum, quod erat Hbertini fihus, in senatum non legit,

locum quidem senatorium ludis et cetera ornamenta reHquit

20 et eum omni ignominia Hberat. Quod cum facit, iudicat
eius sententia gratis esse Oppianicum condemnatum. Et
eundem PopiHum postea Lentulus in ambitus iudicio pro
testimonio diHgentissime laudat. Quare si neque L. GeHi
iudicio stetit Lentulus neque LentuH existimatione contentus

25 fuit GeHius, et si uterque censor censoris opinione standum
non putavit, quid est quam ob rem quisquam nostrum cen-
sorias subscriptiones omnes fixas et in perpetuum ratas putet
esse oportere ?

XLVIII. 133. At in ipsum Habitum animadverterunt.

30 NuHam quidem ob turpitudinem, nuHum ob totius vitae non
dicam vitium, sed erratum. Neque enim hoc homine sanctior
neque probior neque in omnibus officiis retinendis diHgentior
esse quisquam potest : neque iHi aHter dictint, sed eandem

XLix. 136] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 51

illam famam iudicii corrupti secuti sunt : neque ipsi secus
existimant quam nos existimari volumus de huius pudore,
integritate, virtute : sed putarunt praetermitti accusatorem
non posse, cum animadversum esset in iudices. Qua de
re si unum factum ex omni antiquitate protulero, plura non 5
dicam. 134. Non enim mihi exemplum summi et clarissimi
viri, P. Africani, praetereundum videtur : qui cum esset censor
et in equitum censu C. Licinius Sacerdos prodisset, clara voce,
ut omnis contio audire possit, dixit se scire illum verbis con-
ceptis peierasse : si qui contra vellet dicere, usurum esse eum 10
suo testimonio : deinde cum nemo contra diceret, iussit
equum traducere. Ita is, cuius arbitrio et populus Romanus
et exterae gentes contentae esse consuerant, ipse sua scientia
ad ignominiam alterius contentus non fuit. Quod si hoc
Habito facere licuisset, facile illis ipsis iudicibus et falsae 15
suspicioni et invidiae populariter excitatae resjdtisset.

135. Unum etiam est, quod me maxime perturbat, cui loco
respondere vix videor posse, quod elogium recitasti de testa-
mento Cn. Egnati patris, hominis honestissimi videHcet et
sapientissimi : idcirco se exheredasse fiHum, quod is ob Oppi- 20
anici condemnationem pecuniam accepisset. De cuius
hominis levitate et inconstantia plura non dicam : hoc testa-
mentum ipsum, quod recitas, eius modi est, ut ille, cum eum
fiUum exheredaret, quem oderat, ei filio coheredes homines
ahenissimos adiungeret, quem dihgebat. Sed tu, Acci, con- 25
sideres censeo dihgenter, utrum censorium iudicium grave
vehs esse an Egnati. Si Egnati, leve est, quod censores de
ceteris subscripserunt : ipsum enim Cn. Egnatium, quem tu
gravem esse vis, ex senatu eiecerunt : sin autem censorum,
hunc Egnatium, quem pater censoria subscriptione exhere- 30
davit, censores in senatu, cum patrem eicerent, retinuerunt.

XLIX. 136. At enim senatus universus iudicavit illud cor-
ruptum esse iudicium. Quo modo ? Suscepit causam. An

52 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [xLix. 137

potuit rem delatam eius modi repudiare ? cum tribunus plebis
populo concitato rem paene ad manus revocasset, cum vir
optimus et homo innocentissimus pecunia circumventus dice-
retur, cum invidia flagraret ordo senatorius, potuit nihil
5 decerni ? potuit illa concitatio multitudinis sine summo
periculo rei pubHcae repudiari ? At quid est decretum ? quam
iuste ! quam sapienter ! quam dihgenter ! si Qui sunt, quorum

OPERA FACTUM SIT, UT lUDICIUM PUBLICUM CORRUMPERETUR.

Utrum videtur id senatus factum iudicare, an, si factum sit,

10 moleste graviterque ferre? Si ipse A. Cluentius sententiam
de iudiciis rogaretur, aHam non diceret, atque ei dixerunt,
quorum sententiis Cluentium condemnatum esse dicitis. 137.
Sed quaero a vobis num istam legem ex isto senatus consulto
L. Lucullus consul, homo sapientissimus, tulerit : num anno

15 post M. LucuUus et C. Cassius, in quos tum consules desig-
natos idem ilhid senatus decreverat? Non tulerunt : et quod
tu Habiti pecunia factum esse arguis neque id ulla tenuissima
suspicione confirmas, factum est primum illorum aequitate et
sapientia consulum, ut id, quod senatus decreverat ad illud

20 invidiae praesens incendium restinguendum, id postea referen-
dum ad populum non arbitrarentur. Ipse deinde populus
Romanus, qui L. Quincti fictis querimoniis antea concitatus
rem illam et rogationem flagitarat, idem C. luni fihi, pueri
parvuh, lacrimis commotus, maximo clamore et concursu

25 totam quaestionem illam et legem repudiavit. 138. Ex quo
intellegi potuit id, quod saepe dictum est : ut mare, quod
sua natura tranquillum sit, ventorum vi agitari atque turbari,
sic populum Romanum sua sponte esse placatum, hominum
seditiosorum vocibus ut violentissimis tempestatibus concitari.

30 L. Est etiam rehqua permagna auctoritas, quam ego turpiter
paene praeterii : mea enim esse dicitur. Recitavit ex oratione
nescio qua Accius, quam meam esse dicebat, cohortationem
quandam iudicum ad honeste iudicandum et commemoratio-

Li. 140] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 53

nem cum aliorum iudiciorum, quae probata non essent, tum
illius ipsius iudicii luniani : proinde quasi ego non ab initio
huius defensionis dixerim invidiosum illud iudicium fuisse, aut,
cum de infamia iudiciorum disputarem, potuerim illud, quod
tam populare esset, illo tempore praeterire. 139. Ego vero, si 5
quid eius modi dixi, neque cognitum commemoravi neque pro
testimonio dixi, et illa oratio potius temporis mei quam iudicii
et auctoritatis fuit. Cum enim accusarem et mihi initio pro-
posiiissem, ut animos et popuU Romani et iudicum commo-
verem, cumque omnes offensiones iudiciorum non ex mea 10
opinione, sed ex hominum rumore proferrem, istam rem, quae
tam populariter esset agitata, praeterire non potui. Sed errat
vehementer, si quis in orationibus nostris, quas in iudiciis
habuimus, auctoritates nostras consignatas se habere arbitratur.
Omnes enim illae causarum ac temporum sunt, non hominum 15
ipsorum aut patronorum. Nam si causae ipsae pro se loqui
possent, nemo adhiberet oratorem. Nunc adhibemur, ut ea
dicamus, non quae nostra auctoritate constituantur, sed quae
ex re ipsa causaque ducantur. 140. Hominem ingeniosum,
M. Antonium, aiunt sohtum esse dicere idcirco se nullam 20
umquam orationem scripsisse, ut, si quid aliquando
non opus esset ab se esse dictum, posset negare
dixisse : proinde quasi si quid a nobis dictum aut actum sit,
id nisi htteris mandarimus, hominum memoria non compre-
hendatur. v^ 25

LI. Ego vero in isto genere Hbentius cum multorum tum
hominis eloquentissimi et sapientissimi, L. Crassi, auctoritatem
sequor, qui cum Cn. Piancum defenderet, accusante M. Bruto,
homine in dicendo vehementi et calhdo, cum Brutus duobus
recitatoribus constitutis ex duabus eius orationibus capita 30
alterna inter se contraria recitanda curasset, quod in dis-
suasione rogationis eius, quae contra coloniam Narbonensem
ferebatur, quantum potest, de auctoritate senatus detrahit.

54 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [li. 141

in suasione legis Serviliae summis ornat senatum laudibus,
et multa in equites Romanos cum ex ea oratione asperius
dicta recitasset, quo animi illorum iudicum in Crassum
incenderentur, aliquantum esse commotus dicitur. 141. Ita-
5 que in respondendo primum exposuit utriusque rationem
temporis, ut oratio ex re et ex causa habita videretur, deinde
ut intellegere posset Brutus, quem hominem et non solum
qua eloquentia, verum etiam quo lepore et quibus facetiis
praeditum lacessisset, tres ipse excitavit recitatores cum

10 singuhs hbelhs, quos M. Brutus, pater ihius accusatoris, de
iure civih reh&apos;quit. Eorum initia cum recitarentur, ea, quae
vobisnota esse arbitror: &apos; Forte evenit, ut ruri in Priver-
nati essemus ego et Brutus filius,&apos; fundum Privernatem
flagitabat : &apos;In Albano eramus ego et Brutus filius,&apos;

15 Albanum poscebat : &apos;In Tiburti forte quum adsedisse-
mus ego et Brutus filius,&apos; Tiburtem fundum requirebat :
Brutum autem, hominem sapientem, quod fihi nequitiam vide-
ret, quae praedia ei rehnqueret, testificari voluisse dicebat :
quod si potuisset honeste scribere se in balneis cum id aetatis

20 fiho fuisse, non praeterisset : eas tamen ab eo balneas non ex
hbris patris, sed ex tabuhs et ex censu quaerere. Crassus
tum ita Brutum ultus est, ut ihum recitationis suae paeniteret.
Moleste enim fortasse tulerat se in eis orationibus reprehen-
sum, quas de re pubhca habuisset, in quibus forsitan magis

25 requiratur constantia. 142. Ego autem iha recitata esse non
moleste fero. Neque enim ab iho tempore, quod tum erat,
neque ab ea causa, quae tum agebatur, ahena fuerunt : neque
mihi quicquam oneris suscepi, cum ista dixi, quo minus
honeste hanc causam et hbere possem defendere. Quod si

30 vehm confiteri me causam A. Cluenti nunc cognosse, antea
fuisse in iUa populari opinione, quis tandem id possit repre-
hendere ? praesertim, iudices, cum a vobis quoque ipsis hoc
impetrari sit aequissimum, quod ego et ab initio petivi et nunc

Lii. 145] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 55

peto, ut, si quam huc graviorem de illo iudicio opinionem
attulistis, hanc causa perspecta atque omni veritate cognita
deponatis.

LII. 143. Nunc, quoniam ad omnia, quae abs te dicta
sunt, T. Acci, de Oppianici damnatione respondi, confiteare 5
necesse est te opinionem multum fefellisse, quod existimaris
me causam A. Cluenti non facto eius, sed lege defensuru-m.
Nam hoc persaepe dixisti tibi sic renuntiari, me habere in
animo causam hanc praesidio legis defendere. Itane est ? ab
amicis imprudentes videlicet prodimur, et est nescio quis de 10
eis, quos amicos nobis arbitramur, qui nostra consiHa ad
adversarios deferat ? Quisnam hoc tibi renuntiavit ? quis tam
improbus fuit ? cui ego autem narravi ? Nemo, ut opinor, in
culpa est : et nimirum tibi istud lex ipsa renuntiavit. Sed
num tibi ita defendisse videor, ut tota in causa mentionem 15
ullam legis fecerim ? num secus hanc causam defendisse, ac
si lege Habitus teneretur? Certe, ut hominem confirmare
opo rtet, nullus est locus a me purgandi istius invidiosi criminis
praetermissus. 144. Quid ergo est? Quaeret fortassis quis-
piam, displiceatne mihi legum praesidio capitis periculum 20
propulsare ? Mihi vero, iudices, non displicet, sed utor insti-
tuto meo. In hominis honesti prudentisque iudicio non
solum meo consilio uti consuevi, sed multum etiam eius, quem
defendo, et consilio et voluntati obtempero. Nam ut haec ad
me causa delata est, qui leges eas, ad quas adhibemur et in 25
quibus versamur, nosse deberem, dixi Habito statim eo capite,
QUi coissET Quo QUis CONDEMNARETUR, illum cssc libcrum :
teneri autem nostrum ordinem. Atque ille me orare atque
obsecrare coepit, ne se lege defenderem. Cum ego quae
mihi videbantur dicerem, traduxit me ad suam sententiam. 30
Adfirmabat enim lacrimans non se cupidiorem esse civitatis
retinendae quam existimationis. 145. Morem homini gessi, et
tamen idcirco feci — neque enim id semper facere debemus —

56 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [lii. 146

quod videbam per se ipsam causam sine lege copiosissime
posse defendi. Videbam in hac defensione, qua iam sum
usus, plus dignitatis, in illa, qua me hic uti noluit, minus
laboris futurum. Quod si nihil aliud esset actum nisi ut hanc
5 causam obtineremus, lege recitata perorassem.

LIII. Neque me illa oratio commovet, quod ait Accius
indignum esse facinus, si senator iudicio quempiam circum-
venerit, legibus eum teneri : si eques Romanus hoc idem
fecerit, non teneri. 146. Ut tibi concedam hoc indignum

I o esse, quod cuius modi sit iam videro, tu mihi concedas necesse
est multo esse indignius in ea civitate, quae legibus conti-
neatur, discedi ab legibus. Hoc enim vinculum est huius
dignitatis, qua fruimur in re publica, hoc fundamentum
libertatis, hic fons aequitatis : mens et animus et consilium et

15 sententia civitatis posita est in legibus. Ut corpora nostra
sine mente, sic civitas sine lege suis partibus, ut nervis et
sanguine et membris, uti non potest. Legum ministri magi-
stratus, legum interpretes iudices, legum denique idcirco
omnes servi sumus, ut liberi esse possimus. 147. Quid est,

20 Q. Naso, cur tu in isto loco sedeas ? quae vis est qua abs te
hi iudices tali dignitate praediti coerceantur? Vos autem,
iudices, quam ob rem ex tanta multitudine civium tam pauci
de hominum fortunis sententiam fertis ? quo iure Accius quae
voluit dixit ? Cur mihi tam diu potestas dicendi datur ? Quid

25 sibi autem illi scribae, quid Uctores, quid ceteri, quos apparere
huic quaestioni video, volunt ? Opinor haec omnia lege fieri
totumque hoc iudicium, ut ante dixi, quasi mente quadam
regi legis et administrari. Quid ergo ? haec quaestio sola ita
gubernatur? Quid M. Plaetori et C. Flamini inter sicarios?

30 quid C. Orchivi peculatus ? quid mea de pecuniis repetundis ?
quid C. Aquili, apud quem nunc ambitus causa dicitur ? quid
reliquae quaestiones? Circumspicite omnes rei publicae
partes : omnia legum imperio et praescripto fieri videbitis.

Liv. 149] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 57

148. Si qiiis apud me, T. Acci, te reum velit facere, clames te
lege pecuniarum repetundarum non teneri. Neque haec tua
recusatio confessio sit captae pecuniae, sed laboris et periculi
non legitimi declinatio.

LIV. Nunc quid agatur et quid abs te iuris constituatur 5
vide. lubet lex ea, qua lege haec quaestio constituta est,
iudicem quaestionis, hoc est, Q. Voconium, cum eis iudicibus,
qui ei obvenerint — vos appellat, iudices — quaerere de veneno.
In quem quaerere? infinitum est. Quiciimque fecerit,

VENDIDERIT, EMERIT, HABUERIT, DEDERIT. Quid Cadem lex lO

statim adiungit? Recita. Deque eius capite quaerito.
Cuius ? qui coierit ? convenerit ? non ita est. Quid ergo est ?

4ic. QUI TRIBUNUS MILITUM LEGIONIBUS QUATTUOR PRIMIS

QUiVE QUAESTOR, TRiBUNUS PLEBis. Deinccps omncs magis
tratus nominavit. Quive in senatu sententiam dixit, dix- 15
ERiT. Quid tum? QUI eorum coit, coierit, convenit,
convenerit, quo quis iudicio publico condemnaretur.
&apos;Qui eorum.&apos; Quorum? videlicet,quisupra scripti sunt. Quid
intersit utro modo scriptum sit, etsi est apertum, ipsa tamen
lex nos docet. Ubi enim omnes mortales adhgat, ita loquitur : 20
Qui venenum malum fecit, fecerit. Omnes viri, muHeres,
liberi, servi in iudicium vocantur. Si idem de coitione volu-
isset, adiunxisset : Quive coierit. Nunc ita est : Deque
EIUS capite quaerito, qui magistratum habuerit inve
senatu sententiam dixerit: qui eorum coit, coierit. 25

149. Num is est Cluentius ? Certe non est. Quis ergo est
Ckientius ? qui tamen defendi causam suam lege noluit.
Itaque abicio legem : morem Cluentio gero : tibi taraen, Acci,
pauca, quae ab huius causa seiuncta sunt, respondebo. Est
enim quiddam in hac causa quod Cluentius ad se, est ahquid 30
quod ego ad me putem pertinere. Hic sua putat interesse se

re ipsa et gesto negotio, non lege defendi : ego autem mea
existimo interesse me nulla in disputatione ab Accio videri

58 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [lv. 150

esse superatum. Non enim mihi haec causa sola dicenda est.
Omnibus hic labor meus propositus est, quicumque hac fac-
ultate defensionis contenti esse possunt. Nolo quemquam
eorum, qui adsunt, existimare me, quae de lege ab Accio
5 dicta sunt, si reticuerim, comprobare. Quam ob rem, Cluenti,
de te tibi obsequor, neque enim legem recito neque hoc
loco pro te dico, sed ea, quae a me desiderari arbitror, non
relinquam.

LV. 150. Iniquum tibi videtur, Acci, esse non isdem legibus

10 omnes teneri. Primum, ut id iniquissimum esse confitear,
eius modi est, ut commutatis eis opus sit legibus, non ut his,
quae sunt, non pareamus. Deinde quis umquam hoc senator
recusavit, ne quo altiorem gradum dignitatis beneficio populi
Romani esset consecutus, eo se putaret durioribus legum

15 condicionibus uti oportere? Quam multa sunt commoda,
quibus caremus, quam multa molesta et difficilia, quae sub-
imus ! atque haec omnia tantum honoris et amplitudinis
commodo compensantur. Converte nunc ad equestrem
ordinem atque in ceteros ordines easdem vitae condiciones :

20 non perferent : putant enim minus multos sibi laqueos legum
et condicionum ac iudiciorum propositos esse oportere, qui
summum locum civitatis aut non potuerunt ascendere aut non
petiverunt. 151. Atque ut omittam leges alias omnes, quibus
nos tenemur, ceteri autem sunt ordines liberati, hanc ipsam

25 legem : ne quis iudicio circumveniretur, C. Gracchus
tulit : eam legem pro plebe, non in plebem tulit. Postea L.
SuUa, homo a populi causa remotissimus, tamen, cum eius rei
quaestionem hac ipsa lege constitueret, qua vos hoc tempore
iudicatis, populum Romanum, quem ab hoc genere hberum

30 acceperat, adligare novo quaestionis genere ausus non est.
Quod si fieri posse existimasset, pro illo odio, quod habuit in
equestrem ordinem, nihil fecisset libentius, quam omnem illam
acerbitatem proscriptionis suae, qua est usus in veteres iudices,

LVi. 153] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 59

in hanc unam quaestionem contulisset. 152. Nec nunc quic-
quam agitur — mihi credite, iudices, et prospicite id, quod
providendum est — nisi ut equester ordo in huiusce legis
periculum concludatur. Neque hoc agitur ab omnibus, sed a
paucis. Nani ei senatores, qui se facile tuentur integritate et 5
innocentia, quales, ut vere dicam, vos estis, et ceteri, qui sine
cupiditate vixerunt, equites ordini senatorio dignitate proximos,
concordia coniunctissimos esse cupiunt : sed ei, qui sese
volunt posse omnia neque praeterea quicquam esse aut in
homine ullo aut in ordine, hoc uno metu se putant equites 10
Romanos in potestatem suam redacturos, si constitutum sit,
ut de eis, qui rem iudicarint, huiusce modi iudicia fieri possint.
Vident enim auctoritatem huius ordinis confirmari : vident
iudicia comprobari : hoc metu proposito evellere se aculeum
severitatis vestrae posse confidunt. 153. Quis enim de 15
homine audeat paulo maioribus opibus praedito vere et fortiter
iudicare, cum videat sibi de eo, quod coierit aut consenserit,
causam esse dicendam?

LVI. O viros fortes, equites Romanos, qui homini claris-
simo ac potentissimo, M. Druso, tribuno plebis restiterunt, 20
cum ille nihil aliud ageret cum illa cuncta, quae tum erat,
nobihtate, nisi ut ei qui rem iudicassent, huiusce modi quaes-
tionibus in iudicium vocarentur. Tunc C. Flavius Pusio, Cn.
Titinius, C. Maecenas, illa robora popuK Romani ceterique
eiusdem ordinis, non fecerunt idem, quod nunc Cluentius, ut 25
ahquid culpae suscipere se putarent recusando, sed apertissime
repugnarunt, cum haec recusarent et palam fortissime atque
honestissime dicerent se potuisse iudicio popuH Romani in
ampHssimum locum pervenire, si sua studia ad honores
petendos conferre voluissent : sese vidisse, in ea vita quahs 30
splendor inesset, quanta ornamenta, quae dignitas : quae se
non contempsisse, sed ordine suo patrumque suorum contentos
fuisse et vitam illam tranquillam et quietam, remotam a

6o PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [lvi. 154

procellis invidiarum et huiusce modi iudiciorum sequi malu-
isse : 154. aut sibi ad honores petendos aetatem integram
restitui oportere, aut, quoniam id non posset, eam condicionem
vitae, quam secuti petitionem reHquissent, manere : iniquum
5 esse eos, qui honorum ornamenta propter periculorum
multitudinem praetermisissent, populi beneficiis esse privatos,
iudiciorum novorum pericuUs non carere : senatorem hoc
queri non posse, propterea quod ea condicione proposita
petere coepisset, quodque permulta essent ornamenta, quibus

jo eam mitigare molestiam posset, locus, auctoritas, domi
splendor, apud exteras nationes nomen et gratia, toga prae-
texta, sella curuHs, insignia, fasces, exercitus, imperia,
provinciae : quibus in rebus cum summa recte factis maiores
nostri praemia tum plura peccatis pericula proposita esse

15 vokierunt. IIH non hoc recusabant, ne ea lege accusarentur,
qua nunc Habitus accusatur, quae tunc erat Sempronia, nunc
est CorneHa : inteHegebant enim ea lege equestrem ordi-
nem non teneri, sed ne nova lege adHgarentur laborabant.
155. Habitus ne hoc quidem umquam recusavit, quo minus

20 vel ea lege rationem vitae suae redderet, qua non tenetur.
Quae si vobis condicio placet, omnes id agamus, ut haec quam
primum in omnes ordines quaestio perferatur.

LVII. Interea quidem, per deos immortales ! quoniam
omnia commoda nostra, iura, Hbertatem, salutera denique

25 legibus obtinemuSy a legibus non recedamus : simul et iHud
quam sit iniquum cogitemus, populum Romanum aHud nunc
agere : vobis rem pubHcam et fortunas suas commisisse :
sine cura esse : non metuere, ne lege ea, quam numquam
ipse iusserit, et quaestione, qua se solutum Hberumque esse

30 arbitretur, per paucos iudices astringatur. 156. Agit enim sic
causam T. Accius, adulescens bonus et disgrtus, omnes cives
legibus teneri omnibus : vos attenditis et auditis silentio,
sicut facere debetis. A. Cluentius causam dicit eques Ro-

manus ea lege, qua lege senatores et ei, qui magistratum habu-
erunt, soli tenentur : mihi per eum recusare et in arce legis
praesidia constituere defensionis meae non Hcet. Si obtinu-
erit causam Cluentius, sicuti vestra aeauitate nixi confidimus,
omnes existimabunt, id quod erit, obtinuisse propter innocen- 5
tiam, quoniam ita defensus sit : in lege autem, quam attingere
noluerit, praesidii nihil fuisse. 157- Hic nunc est quiddam,
quod ad me pertineat, de quo ante dixi, quod ego populo
Romano praestare debeam, quoniam is vitae meae status est,
ut omnis mihi cura et opera posita sit in hominum periculis 10
defendendis. Video quanta et quam periculosa et quam in-
finita quaestio temptetur ab accusatoribus, cum eam legem,
quae in nostrum ordinem scripta sit, in populum Romanum
transferre conentur. Qua in lege est : qui coierit, quod
quam late pateat videtis : convenerit, aeque incertum et in- 15
finitum est : consenserit, hoc vero cum infinitum tum obscu-
rum et occultum : falsumve testimonium dixerit, quis de
plebe Romana testimonium dixit umquam, cui non hoc peri-
culum T. Accio auctore paratum esse videatis ? Nam dictu-
rum quidem certe, si hoc iudicium plebi Romanae propositum 20
sit, neminem umquam esse confirmo. 158. Sed hoc poUiceor
omnibus, si cui forte hac lege negotium facessetur, qui lege
non teneatur, si is uti me defensore voluerit, me eius causam
legis praesidio defensurum, et vel his iudicibus vel horum
simiHbus facillime probaturum et omni me defensione usurum 25
esse legis, qua nunc ut utar, ab eo, cuius vokmtati mihi ob-
temperandum est, non conceditur.

LVIIL Non enim debeo dubitare, iudices, quin, si qua ad
vos causa eius modi delata sit eius, qui&apos;lege non teneatur,
etiam si is invidiosus aut multis offensus esse videatur, etiam 30
si eum oderitis, etiam si inviti absoluturi sitis, tamen absolva-
tis et rehgioni potius vestrae quam odio pareatis. 159. Est
enim sapientis iudicis cogitare tantum sibi a populo Romano

62 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [lviii. i6o

esse permissum, quantum commissum sit et creditum, et non
solum sibi potestatem datam, verum etiam fidem habitam esse
meminisse : posse quem oderit absolvere, quem non oderit .
condemnare, et semper non quid ipse velit, sed quid lex et
5 religio cogat cogitare : animadvertere qua lege reus citetur, de
quo reo cognoscat, quae res in quaestione versetur. Cum
haec sunt videnda, tum vero illud est hominis magni, iudices, «-^
atque sapientis, cum illam iudicandi caus a tabellam sumpserit, ^
non se reputare solum esse neque sibi quodcumque concu-

lo pierit Hcere, sed habere in consiUo legem, reUgionem, aequi-
tatem, fidem : libidinem autem, odium, invidiam, metum cu-
piditatesque omnes amovere maximique aestimare conscien-
tiam mentis suae, quam ab dis immortaUbus accepimus, quae
a nobis diveUi non potest : quae si optimorum consiliorum

1 5 atque factorum testis in omni vita nobis erit, sine ullo metu et
summa cum honestate vivemus. i6o. Haec si T. Accius aut
cognovisset aut cogitasset, profecto ne conatus quidem esset
dicere, id quod multis verbis egit, iudicem, quod ei videatur,
statuere et non devinctum legibus esse oportere. Quibus

2o de rebus mihi pro Cluenti voluntate nimium, pro rei digni-
tate parum, pro vestra prudentia satis dixisse videor. ReHqua
perpauca sunt, quae, quia vestrae quaestionis erant, idcirco
illi statuerunt fingenda esse sibi et proferenda, ne omnium
turpissimi reperirentur, si in iudicium nihil praeter invidiam

25 attuhssent.

LIX. Atque ut existimetis me necessario de his rebus, de
quibus iam dixerim, pluribus egisse verbis, attendite rehqua :
profecto inteUegetis ea, quae paucis demonstrari potuerint,
brevissime esse defensa.

30 161. Cn. Decidio Samniti, ei, qui proscriptus est, iniuriam
in calamitate eius ab huius famiha factam esse dixistis. Ab
nuho iUe hberahus quam a Cluentio tractatus est. Huius
iUum opes in rebus eius incommodissimis sublevarunt, atque

Lix. 164] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 63

hoc ciim ipse tum eius amici necessariique omnes cognorunt.
Anchari et Paceni pastoribus huius viHcum vim et manus
attulisse. Cum quaedam in callibus, ut solet, controversia
pastorum esset orta, Habiti vihci rem domini et privatam
possessionem defenderunt. Cum esset expostulatio facta, 5
causa illis demonstrata, sine iudicio controversiaque discessum
est. 162. P. Aeli testamento propinquus exheredatus cum
esset, heres hic alienior institutus est. P. AeHus Habiti
merito fecit, neque hic in testamento faciendo interfuit, idque
testamentum ab huius inimico Oppianico est obsignatum. 10
Floro legatum ex testamento infitiatum esse. Non est ita.
Sed cum HS x3cx scripta essent pro HS ccc, neque ei
cautum satis videretur, voluit eum aliquid acceptum referre
Hberalitati suae. Primo debere negavit : post sine controversia
solvit. Cei cuiusdam Samnitis uxorem post beHum ab hoc 15
esse repetitam. MuHerem cum emisset a sectoribus, quo
tempore eam primum Hberam esse audivit, sine iudicio reddi-
dit Ceio. 163. Ennium esse quendam, cuius bona teneat
Habitus. Est hic Ennius egens quidam calumniator, mer-
cenarius Oppianici, qui permultos annos quievit : deinde 20
aHquando cum servis Habiti furti egit : nuper ab ipso Habito
petere coepit. Hic iHo privato iudicio, mihi credite, vobis
isdem fortasse patronis, calumniam non effugiet. Atque etiam,
ut nobis renuntiatur, hominem multorum hospitum, Ambi-
vium quendam, coponem de via Latina, subornatis, qui sibi 25
a Cluentio servisque eius in taberna sua manus adlatas esse
dicat. Quo de homine nihil etiam nunc dicere nobis est ne-
cesse. Si invitaverit, id quod solet, sic hominem accipiemus,
ut moleste ferat se de via decessisse. 164. Habetis, iudices,
quae in totam vitam de moribus A. Cluenti, quem iHi invi- 30
diosum esse reum volunt, annos octo meditati accusatores
coUegerunt. Quam levia genere ipso ! quam falsa re ! quam
brevia responsu !

64 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [lx. 165

LX. Cognoscite nunc id, quod ad vestrum ius iurandum
pertinet, quod vestri iudicii est, quod vobis oneris imposuit ea
lex, qua coacti huc convenistis, de criminibus veneni : ut
omnes intellegant quam paucis verbis haec causa perorari
5 potuerit et quam multa a me dicta sint, quae ad huius volun-
tatem maxime, ad vestrum iudicium minime pertinerent.

165. Obiectum est Vibium Cappadocem ab hoc A. Clu-
entio veneno esse sublatum. Opportune adest homo summa
fide et omni virtute praeditus, L, Plaetorius, senator, qui

10 illius Vibihospes fuit et familiaris. Apud hunc ille Romae
habitavit, apud hunc aegrotavit, huius domi est mortuus. In-
testatum dico esse mortuum possessionemque eius bonorum,
ex edicto praetoris, huic, illius sororis fiHo, adulescenti puden-
tissimo et in primis honesto, equiti Romano datam, Numerio

15 Cluentio, quem videtis.

166. Alterum veneficii crimen Oppianico huic adulescenti,
cum eius in nuptiis more Larinatium multitudo hominum
pranderet, venenum Habiti consilio paratum : id cum daretur
in mulso, Balbutium quendam, eius famiharem, intercepisse,

20 bibisse statimque esse mortuum. Hoc ego si sic agerem,
tamquam mihi crimen esset diluendum, haec pluribus [ver-
bis] dicerem, per quae nunc paucis percurrit oratio mea.
167. Quid umquam Habitus in se admisit, ut hoc tantum
ab eo facinus non abhqrrere videatur? quid autem magno

25 opere Oppianicum metuebat, cum ille verbum omnino in hac
ipsa causa nullum facere potuerit, huic autem accusatores
viva matre deesse non possint ? id quod iam intellegetis. An
ut de causa eius pericuH nihil decederet, ad causam novum
crimen accederet ? Quod autem tempus veneni dandi illo die,

30 illa frequentia ? per quem porro datum ? unde sumptum ?
quae deinde interceptio pocuh ? cur non de integro autem
datum ? Multa sunt, quae dici possunt : sed non committam
ut videar non dicendo voluisse dicere : res enim se ipsa de-

LXi. 170] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 65

fendit. 168. Nego illum adulescentem, quem statim epoto
poculo mortuum esse dixistis, omnino illo die esse mortuum.
Magnum crimen et impudens mendacium. Perspicite cetera.
Dico illum, cum ad illud prandium crudior venisset et, ut
aetas illa fert, sibi tum non pepercisset, aliquot dies aegrotasse 5
et ita esse mortuum. Quis huic rei testis est ? Idem, qui sui
luctus, pater : pater, inquam, illius adulescentis : quem propter
animi dolorem pertenuis suspicio potuisset ex illo loco testem
in A. Cluentium constituere, is hunc suo testimonio sublevat ;
quod recita. Tu autem, nisi molestum est, paulisper exsurge : lo
perfer hunc dolorem commemorationis necessariae : in qua
ego diutius non morabor, quoniam, quod fuit viri optimi, fecisti,
ut ne cui innocenti maeror tuus calamitatem et falsum crimen
adferret.

LXI. 169. Unum etiam mihi rehquum eius modi crimen 15
est, iudices, ex quo illud perspicere possitis, quod a me
initio orationis meae dictum est : quicquid maH per hosce
annos A. Cluentius viderit, quicquid hoc tempore habuerit
solHcitudinis ac negotii, id omne a matre esse conflatum*
Oppianicum veneno necatum esse, quod ei datum sit in pane 20
per M. AseUium quendam, famiHarem iUius, idque Habiti
consiHo factum esse dicitis. In quo primum iflud quaero,
quae causa Habito fuerit, cur interficere Oppianicum veUet.
Inimicitias enim fuisse confiteor, sed homines inimicos suos
morte adfici volunt, aut quod eos metuunt aut quod oderunt. 25
170. Quo tandem igitur Habitus metu adductus tantum in se
facinus suscipere conatus est ? quid erat quod iam Oppianicum
)oena adfectum pro maleficiis et eiectum e civitate quisquam
timeret? quid metuebat? ne oppugnaretur a perdito, an ne
iccusaretur a damnato, an ne exsuHs testimonio laederetur? 30
&gt;i autem quod oderat Habitus inimicum, idcirco illum vita
:ui noluit, adeone erat stultus, ut iHam, quam tum iUe vivebat;,
atam esse arbitraretur, damnati, exsuHs, deserti ab omnibus,

E

66 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [lxi. 171

quem propter animi importunitatem nemo recipere tecto, nemo
adire, nemo adloqui, nemo aspicere vellet ? Huius igitur
Habitus vitae invidebat? 171. Hunc si acerbe et penitus
oderat, non eum quam diutissime vivere velle debebat? huic
5 mortem maturabat inimicus, quod illi unum in malis erat
perfugium calamitatis ? qui si quid animi et virtutis habuisset,
ut multi saepe fortes viri in eius modi dolore, mortem sibi ipse
conscisset : huic quam ob rem id vellet inimicus offerre, quod
ipse sibi optare deberet ? Nam nunc quidem quid tandem illi

10 mali mors attulit? nisi forte ineptis fabulis ducimur, ut existi-
memus illum ad inferos impiorum supplicia perferre ac plures
illic offendisse inimicos, quam hic reliquisse : a socrus, ab
uxorum, a fratris, a liberum Poenis actum esse praecipitem in
sceleratorum sedem ac regionem. Quae si falsa sunt, id quod

15 omnes intellegunt, quid ei tandem eripuit mors praeter sensum
doloris? 172. Age vero, per quem venenum datum? Per
M. Asellium.

LXII. Quid huic cum Habito ? nihil : qJLQue adeo, quod
ille Oppianico familiarissime est usus, potius etiam simultas.

20 Eine igitur, quem sibi oifensiorem, Oppianico familiarissimum
sciebat esse, potissimum et scelus suura et illius periculum
committebat ? Cur igitur tu, qui pietate ad accusandum ex-
citatus es, hunc Asellium esse inultum tam diu sinis ? cur non
Habiti exemplo usus es, ut per illum, qui attulisset venenum,

25 de hoc praeiudicaretur ? 173. lam vero illud quam non pro-
babile, quam inusitatum, iudices, quam novum, in pane datum
venenum ! Faciliusne potuit quam in poculo, latius potuit
abditum aliqua in parte panis, quam si totum coUiquefactum in
potione esset, celerius potuit comestum quam epotum in venas

30 atque in omnes partes corporis permanare? facilius fallere in
pane,( si esset animadversum,^; quam in poculo, cum ita con-
fusum esset, ut secerni nullo modo posset ? At repentina morte
periit. 174. Quod si esset ita factum, tamen ea res propter

I
I

LXiii. 176] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 67

multorum eius modi casum minime firmam veneni suspicionem
haberet : quodsi esset suspiciosum, tamen potius ad alios quam
ad Habitum pertineret. Verum in eo ipso homines impu-
dentissime mentiuntur. Id ut intellegatis, et mortem eius et
quem ad modum post mortem in Habitum sit crimen a matre 5
quaesitum cognoscite.

175. Cum vagus et exsul erraret atque undique exclusus
Oppianicus in Falernum se ad L. Quinctium contulisset, ibi
primum in morbum incidit ac satis vehementer diuque
aegrotavit. Cum esset una Sassia eaque Sex. Albio quodam 10
colono, homine valenti, qui simul esse solebat, famiHarius
uteretur, quam vir dissolutissimus incolumi fortuna pati posset,
et ius illud matrimonii castum atque legitimum damnatione
viri sublatum arbitraretur, Nicostratus quidam, fidelis Oppia-
nici servulus, percuriosus et minime mendax, multa dicitur 15
domino renuntiare soUtus esse. Interea Oppianicus cum iam
convalesceret neque improbitatem coloni in Falerno diutius
ferre posset et huc ad urbem profectus esset — solebat enim
extra portam ahquid habere conducti — cecidisse de equo
dicitur et homo infirma valetudine latus offendisse vehementer, 20
et, postea quam ad urbem cum febri venerit, paucis diebus
esse mortuus. Mortis ratio, iudices, eius modi est, ut aut
nihil habeat suspicionis aut, si quid habet, id intra parietes in
domestico scelere versetur.

LXIII. 176. Post mortem eius [Sassia] moHri statim nefaria 25
muHer coepit insidias fiHo : quaestionem habere de viri morte
constituit. Emit de A. RupiHo, quo erat usus Oppianicus
medico, Stratonem quendam, quasi ut idem faceret quod
Habitus in emendo Diogene fecerati De hoc Stratone et de
Ascla quodam servo suo quaesituram esse dixit. Praeterea 3°
servum iUum Nicostratum, quem nimium loquacem fuisse ac
nimium domino fidelem arbitrabatur, ab hoc adulescente
Oppianico in quaestionem postulavit. Hic cum esset illo

68 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [lxiii. 177

tempore puer et illa quaestio de patris sui morte constitui
diceretur, etsi illum servum et sibi benevolum esse et
patri fuisse arbitrabatur, nihil tamen est ausus recusare. Ad-
vocantur amici et hospites Oppianici et ipsius mulieris multi,
5 homines honesti atque omnibus rebus ornati. Tormentis
omnibus vehementissime quaeritur. Cum essent animi ser-
vorum et spe et metu temptati, ut ahquid in quaestione
dicerent, tamen, ut arbitror, auctoritate advocatorum atque vt
tormentorum adducti, in veritate manserunt neque se quicquam

10 scire dixerunt. 177. Quaestio illo die de amicorum sententia
dimissa est. Satis longo intervallo post iterum advocantur.
Habetur de integro quaestio : nulla vis tormentorum acer-
rimorum praetermittitur : adversari advocati et iam vix ferre
posse, furere crudelis atque importuna mulier, sibi nequa-

15 quam, ut sperasset, ea, quae cogitasset, procedere. Cum
iam tortor atque essent tormenta ipsa defessa neque tamen
illa finem facere vellet, quidam ex advocatis, homo et hono-
ribus populi ornatus et summa virtute praeditus, intellegere
se dixit non id agi, ut verum inveniretur, sed ut ahquid falsi

20 dicere cogerentur. Hoc postquam ceteri comprobarunt, ex
omnium sententia constitutum est satis videri esse quaesitum.
178. Redditur Oppianico Nicostratus, Larinum ipsa pro-
ficiscitur cum suis maerens, quod iam certe incolumem fiUum
fore putabat, ad quem non modo verum crimen, sed ne ficta

25 quidem suspicio perveniret et cui non modo aperta inimjcorum
oppugnatio, sed ne occultae quidem matris insidiae nocere
potuissent. Larinum postquam venit, quae a Stratone illo
venenum antea viro suo datum sibi persuasum esse simulasset,
instructam ei continuo et ornatam Larini medicinae exer-

30 cendae causa tabernam dedit.

LXIV. Unum, alterum, tertium annum Sassia quiescebat,
ut velle atque optare ahquid calamitatis fifio potius quam id
struere et moHri videretur. 179. Tum interim Q. Hortensio

k

LXiv. 181] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 69

Q. Metello consulibus, ut hunc Oppianicum aliud agentem ac
nihil eius modi cogitantem ad hanc accusationem detraheret,
invito despondit ei filiam suam, illam, quam ex genero
susceperat, ut eum nuptiis adligatum simul et testamenti spe
devinctum possit habere in potestate. Hoc ipso fere tempore 5
Strato ille medicus domi furtum fecit et caedem eius modi.
Cum esset in aedibus armarium, in quo sciret esse nummorum
aliquantum et auri, noctu duos conservos dormientes occidit
in piscinamque deiecit : ipse armarii fundum exsecuit, et HS

et auri quinque pondo abstuHt, uno ex servis puero 10

non grandi conscio. 180. Furto postridie cognito omnis
suspicio in eos servos, qui non comparebant, commovebatur.
Cum exsectio illa fundi in armario animadverteretur, quae-
rebant homines quonam modo fieri potuisset. Quidam ex
amicis Sassiae recordatus est se nuper in auctione quadam 15
vidisse in rebus minutis aduncam ex omni parte dentatam et
tortuosam venire serrulam, qua illud potuisse ita circumsecari
videretur. Ne multa : perquiritur a coactoribus : invenitur ea
serrula ad Stratonem pervenisse. Hoc initio suspicionis orto
et aperte insimulato Stratone puer ille conscius pertimuit : 20
rem omnem dominae indicavit, homines in piscina inventi
sunt, Strato in vincula coniectus est atque etiam in taberna
eius nummi, nequaquam omnes, reperiuntur. 181. Constituitur
quaestio de furto. Nam quid quisquam suspicari aHud
potest? An hoc dicitis? armario expilato, pecunia ablata, 25
non omni reciperata, occisis hominibus, institutam esse quae-
stionem de morte Oppianici? cui probatis? quid est quod
minus veri simile proferre possitis? Deinde, ut omittam cetera,
triennio post mortem Oppianici de eius morte quaerebatur ?
Atque etiam incensa odio pristino Nicostratum eundem illum 30
tum sine causa in quaestionem postulavit. Oppianicus primo
recusavit. Postea, cum illa abducturam se filiam, mutaturam

muUeri crudelissimae servum

70 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [lxv. 182

tidelissimum non in quaestionem tulit, sed plane ad supplicium
dedidit.

LXV. 182. Post triennium igitur agitata denuo quaestio de
viri morte habebatur, et de quibus servis habebatur ? Nova,
5 credo, res obiecta, novi quidam homines in suspicionem
vocati sunt ? De Stratone et de Nicostrato. Quid ? Romae
quaesitum de istis hominibus non erat ? Itane tandem ?
mulier iam non morbo, sed scelere furiosa, cum quaestionem
habuisses Romae, cum de T. Anni, L, Rutili, P. Saturi,

10 ceterorum honestissimorum virorum sententia constitutum
esset satis quaesitum videri, eadem de re triennio post, isdem
de hominibus, nullo adhibito non dicam viro, ne colonum
forte adfuisse dicatis, sed bono viro, in fiHi caput quaestionem
habere conata es ? 183. An hoc dicitis — mihi enim venit in

15 mentem quid dici possit, tametsi ab hoc non esse hoc dictum
mementote — cum haberetur de furto quaestio, Stratonem
aliquid de veneno esse confessum ? Hoc uno modo, iudices,
saepe multorum improbitate depressa veritas emergit et
innocentiae defensio interclusa respirat, quod aut ei, qui ad

20 fraudem caUidi sunt, non tantum audent, quantum excogitant,
aut ei, quorum eminet audacia atque proiecta est, a consihis
malitiae deseruntur. Quod si aut confidens astutia aut callida
esset audacia, vix ullo eis obsisti modo posset. Utrum furtum
factum non est ? At nihil clarius Larini. An ad Stratonem

25 suspicio non pertinuit ? At is et ex serrula insimulatus et a
puero conscio est indicatus. An id actum non est in quae-
rendo? Quae fuit igitur alia causa quaerendi? an, id quod
vobis dicendum est et quod tum Sassia dictitavit, cum de
furto quaereretur, tum Stratonem isdem in tormentis dixisse

30 de veneno ? 184. En hoc illud est, quod ante dixi : mulier
abundat audacia, consiUo et ratione deficitur. Nam tabellae
quaestionis plures proferuntur, quae recitatae vobisque editae
sunt, illae ipsae, quas tum obsignatas esse dixit : in quibus

Lxvi. 187] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 71

tabellis de furto nulla littera invenitur. Non venit in mentem,
primum orationem Stratonis conscribere de furto, post aliquod
dictum adiungere de veneno, quod non percontatione quae-
situm, sed per dolorem expressum videretur. Quaestio de
furto est, veneni iam suspicio superiore quaestione sublata : 5
quod ipsum haec eadem mulier iudicarat, quae ut Romae de
amicorum sententia statuerat satis esse quaesitum, postea per
triennium maxime ex omnibus servis Stratonem illum dilexerat,
in honore habuerat, commodis omnibus adfecerat. 185. Cum
igitur de furto quaereretur et eo furto, quod ille sine contro- 10
versia fecerat, tum ille de eo, quod quaerebatur, verbum
nullum fecit ? De veneno statim dixit ? de furto si non eo
loco, quo debuit, ne in extrema quidem aut media aut aHqua
denique parte quaestionis verbum fecit ullum ?

LXVI. lam videtis illam nefariam muHerem, iudices, 15
eadem manu, qua, si detur potestas, interficere fiHum cupiat,
hanc fictam quaestionem conscripsisse. Atque istam ipsam
quaestionem dicite qui obsignarit unum aliquem nominatim :
neminem reperietis, nisi forte eius modi hominem, quem ego
proferri malim quam neminem nominari. 186. Quid ais, T. 20
Acci ? tu periculum capitis, tu indicium sceleris, tu fortunas
alterius fitteris conscriptas in iudicium adferas : neque earum
auctorem litterarum neque obsignatorem neque testem ullum
nominabis ? et quam tu pestem innocentissimo fiUo de matris
sinu deprompseris, hanc hi tales viri comprobabunt ? Esto : 25
in tabelHs nihil est auctoritatis : quid, ipsa quaestio iudicibus,
quid, amicis hospitibusque Oppianici, quos adhibuerat antea,
quid, huic tandem ipsi tempori cur non servata est ? Quid istis
hominibus factum est, Stratone et Nicostrato ? 187. Quaero
abs te, Oppianice, servo tuo Nicostrato quid factum esse 30
dicas : quem tu, cum hunc brevi tempore accusaturus esses,
Romam deducere, dare potestatem indicandi, incolumem
denique servare quaestioni, servare his iudicibus, servare huic

y2 PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. [lxvi. i88

tempori debuisti. Nam Stratonem quidem, iudices, in crucem
esse actum exsecta scitote lingua : quod nemo Larinatium
est qui nesciat. Timuit mulier amens non suam conscientiam,
non odium municipum, non famam omnium, sed quasi non
5 omnes eius sceleris testes essent futuri, sic metuit, ne con-
demnaretur extrema servuli voce morientis.

l88. Quod hoc portentum, di immortales ! quod tantum
monstrum in ullis locis, quod tam infestum scelus et immane
aut unde natum esse dicamus? lam enim videtis profecto,

lo iudices, non sine necessariis me ac maximis causis principio
orationis meae de matre dixisse. Nihil est enim mali, nihil
sceleris, quod illa non ab initio fiUo voluerit, optaverit,
cogitaverit, effecerit. Mitto illam primam libidinis iniuriam,
mitto nefarias generi nuptias, mitto cupiditate matris expul-

15 sam ex matrimonio filiam : quae nondum ad huiusce vitae
periculum, sed ad commune familiae dedecus pertinebant.
Nihil de alteris Oppianici nuptiis queror : quarum illa cum
obsides fihos ab eo mortuos accepisset, tum denique in
familiae luctum atque in privignorum funus nupsit. Praetereo,

20 quod A. Aurium, cuius illa quondam socrus, paulo ante uxor
fuisset, cum Oppianici esse opera proscriptum occisumque
cognosset, eam sibi domum sedemque delegit, in qua cotidie
superioris viri mortis indicia et spolia fortunarum viderit.
189. Illud primum queror de illo scelere, quod nunc denique

25 patefactum est, Fabriciani veneni — quod iam tum recens
suspiciosum ceteris, huic incredibile, nunc vero apertum iam
omnibus ac manifestum videtur — non est profecto de illo
veneno celata mater : nihil est ab Oppianico sine consilio
mulieris cogitatum : quod si esset, certe postea, deprehensa

30 re, non illa ut a viro improbo discessisset, sed ut a crude-
lissimo hoste fugisset domumque illam in perpetuum sce-
lerum omnium adfluentem reHquisset. 190. Non modo id non
fecit, sed ab illo tempore nullum locum praetermisit, in quo

LXViiL 192] PRO A. CLUENTIO ORATIO. 73

non strueret insidias aliquas ac dies omnes atque noctes tota
mente mater de pernicie filii cogitaret. Quae primum ut
illum confirmaret Oppianicum accusatorem filio suo, donis
muneribus, collocatione filiae, spe hereditatis obstrinxit.

LXVII. Ita quod apud ceteros novis inter propinquos 5
susceptis inimicitiis saepe fieri divortia atque adfinitatum
discidia vidimus, haec muHer satis firmum accusatorem filio
suo fore neminem putavit, nisi qui in matrimonium sororem
eius antea duxisset. Ceteri novis adfinitatibus adducti veteres
inimicitias saepe deponunt : illa sibi ad confirmandas 10
inimicitias adfinitatis coniunctionem pignori fore putavit.
191. Neque in eo solum diligens fuit, ut accusatorem filio
suo compararet, sed etiam cogitavit, quibus eum rebus armaret.
Hinc enim illae sollicitationes servorum et minis et promissis,
hinc illae infinitae crudelissimaeque de morte Oppianici quae- 15
stiones : quibus finem aliquando non mulieris modus, sed
amicorum auctoritas fecit. Ab eodem scelere illae triennio
post habitae Larini quaestiones : eiusdem amentiae falsae
conscriptiones quaestionum : ex eodem furore etiam illa
conscelerata exsectio hnguae : totius denique huius ab illa 20
est et inventa et adornata comparatio criminis. 192. Atque
his rebus cum instructum accusatorem fiho suo Romam
misisset, ipsa pauHsper conquirendorum et conducendorum
testium causa Larini est commorata : postea autem, quam
appropinquare huius iudicium ei nuntiatum est, confestim huc 25
advolavit, ne aut accusatoribus diHgentia aut pecunia testi-
bus deesset aut ne forte mater hoc sibi optatissimum
spectaculum huius sordium atque luctus et tanti squaloris
amitteret.

LXVIII. lam vero quod iter Romam eius muHeris fuisse 30
existimatis? quod ego propter vicinitatem Aquinatium et
Fabraternorum ex multis audivi et comperi : quos concursus
in his oppidis ? quantos et virorum et muHerum gemitus esse

factos? mulierem quandam Larinatem illim usque a mari supero
Romam proficisci cum magno comitatu et pecunia, quo faci-
lius circumvenire iudicio capitis atque opprimere filium pos-
set. 193. Nemo erat illorum, paene dicam, quin expiandum
5 illum locum esse arbitraretur, quacumque illa iter fecisset :
nemo quin terram ipsam violari, quae mater est omnium,
vestigiis consceleratae matris putaret. Itaque nullo in oppido
consistendi potestas ei fuit : nemo ex tot hospitibus inventus
est qui non contagionem aspectus fugeret. Nocti se potius

10 ac solitudini quam ulli aut urbi aut hospiti committebat.
194. Nunc vero quid agat, quid moliatur, quid denique cotidie
cogitet quem ignorare nostrorum putat? Quos appellarit,
quibus pecuniam promiserit, quorum fidem pretio labefactare
conata sit tenemus. Quin etiam nocturna sacrificia, quae

15 putat occultiora esse, sceleratasque eius preces et nefaria vota
cognovimus : quibus illa etiam deos immortales de suo scelere
testatur neque intellegit pietate et religione et iustis precibus
deorum mentes, non contaminata superstitione neque ad
scelus perficiendum caesis hostiis posse placari. Cuius ego

20 furorem atque crudelitatem deos immortales a suis aris atque
templis aspernatos esse confido.

LXIX. 195. Vos iudices, quos huic A. Ckientio quasi
aliquos deos ad omne vitae tempus fortuna esse voluit, huius
importunitatem matris a filii capite depellite. Multi saepe in

25 iudicando peccata Hberum parentum misericordiae concess-
erunt : vos ne huius honestissime actam vitam matris crudeli-
tati condonetis rogamus, praesertim cum ex altera parte to-
tum municipium videre possitis. Omnes scitote, iudices —
incredibile dictu est, sed a me verissime dicetur — omnes

30 Larinates, qui valuerunt, venisse Romam, ut hunc studio fre-
quentiaque sua quantum possent in tanto eius periculo sub-
levarent. Pueris illud hoc tempore et mulieribus oppidum

aeque et eos, quos praesentes videtis, huius exspectatio
iudicii dies noctesque sollicitat. 196. Non illi vos de
unius municipis fortunis arbitrantur, sed de totius muni-
cipii statu, dignitate commodisque omnibus sententias esse 5
laturos. Summa est enim, iudices, hominis in com-
munem municipii rem diligentia, in singulos municipes
benignitas, in omnes homines lustitia et fides. Praeterea
nobilitatem illam inter suos locumque a maioribus traditum
sic tuetur,ut maiorum gravijtatem, constantiam, gratiam, liberali- 10
tatem adsequatur. Itaque eis eum verbis publice laudant, ut
non solum testimonium suum iudiciumque significent, verum
etiam curam animi ac dolorem. Quae dum laudatio recitatur,
vos quaeso, qui eam detulistis, adsurgite. 197. Ex lacrimis
horum, iudices, existimare potestis, omnes haec decuriones de- 15
crevisse lacrimantes. Age vero, vicinorum quantum studium,
quam incredibilis benevolentia, quanta cura est ! Non ilH in
libellis laudationem decretam miserunt, sed homines honestis-
simos, quos nossemus omnes, huc frequentes adesse et hunc
praesentes laudare voluerunt. Adsunt Ferentani, homines 20
nobiHssimi, Marrucini item pari dignitate : Teano Apulo
atque Luceria equites Romanos, homines honestissimos, lau-
datores videtis : Boviano totoque ex Samnio cum laudationes
honestissimae missae sunt tum homines amplissimi nobiUssimi-
que venerunt. 198. lam qui in agro Larinati praedia, qui ne- 25

laborent. Non multi mihi ab uno sic diligi videntur, ut hic ab

de te, P. Volumni, quoniam iudex es in A. Cluentium, dici-
mus. Et, ne longum sit, omnium vicinorum summam esse in
hunc benevolentiam confirmamus. 199. Horum omnium

10 tam hanc causam vetere instituto solus peroravi, vestramque
simul, iudices, aequitatem et mansuetudinem una mater op-

retardavit, quae vitiis animi in deterrimas partes iura homi-

15 num convertit omnia, cuius ea stultitia est, ut eam nemo
hominem, ea vis, ut nemo feminam, ea crudelitas, ut nemo
matrem appellare possit. Atque etiam nomina necessitudi-
num, non sokim naturae nomen et iura mutavit : uxor generi,
noverca fiUi, fiHae pelex : eo iam denique adducta est, uti sibi

20 praeter formam nihil ad similitudinem hominis reservarit.
200. Quare, iudices, si scelus odistis, prohibete aditum ma-
tris a filii sanguine, date parenti hunc incredibilem dolorem ex
salute, ex victoria liberum : patimini matrem, ne orbata fiho
laetetur, victam potius vestra aequitate discedere. Sin autem,

huius ex mediis mortis insidiis vita ad luctum conservata,

hac omni est oratione propositum; Caes., Gallia est omnis divisa in partes
tres,with Verr. ii. i. § 34, haec eadem erit quadripartita distributio totius ac-
cusationis meae. It may be omitted in translating. The Exordium {§§ 1-8)
opens with the &apos;Partitio&apos; of the subject into &apos;invidia&apos; or prejudice, and
&apos; crimina &apos; or substantive charges. This contrast runs through the first
three sections, being no less than six times renewed, but so skilfully varied
as to secure the maximum of repetition with the minimum of tediousness.
In § I the order is invidia )( crimina : in §§ 2, 3, crimina )( invidia :
then declining on to invidia, Cicero gives the keynote of the first and
main part of his argument (§§ 9-142) at the end of the section. 2. altera
is in both places abl. case, the subject to videbatur being accusator.
When there is a choice, Latin generally prefers a personal to an imper-
sonal subject for a verb of action. 3. iam : after the lapse of eight years ;
V. Introd. invidia iud. lun. : the Latin genitive is used with much
pregnancy of meaning, especially by Cicero, being applied to every kind of
relation ; in this passage, to that of cause and effect. This use connects
ahke with the possessive and the objective uses. It may be classed as a
genitive ofthe remoter object, answering to a prepositional phrase such as
ob iudicium. Cp. Mur. § 56, odio inimicitiarum ; Scatir. § II, discessus
solitudo ; Verg. A. ii. 413, ereptae virginis ira, &apos;originating in,&apos; &apos;entailed

r. 525^.^ &apos; Prejudice which the trial before Junius has left.&apos; In § 128,
flagitium rei militaris = flagitium in re m. admissum : another variety
of this genitive. Invidia {originally the * fascination &apos; of the evil eye)
is used in a passive sense, &apos; unpopularity,&apos; as well as in an active sense,
&apos;ill-will, &apos; &apos; prejudice,&apos; aegritudo suscepta propter alterius res secundas quae
nihil nocent inv ident i {C\c. Tusc. iv. § 17). The idea of unfairness ^ex-

et sometimes connects the members of a divided whole, Invidia,
crimina, are the proposed divisions of the speech. In such a context et
takes a quasi-disjunctive force, and in some constructions must be trans-
lated accordingly : e.g. Tac. Ann. ii. 66, ius et iniuriam discreturos,

§ 195, quos tamen ipsosaeque, ^/ eosquospraesentesvidetis . . . sollicitat,

gentia is &apos;careful attention,&apos; &apos;scrutiny of the charges made &apos; ; yf^/^i&apos;, thc
sense of honour which prompts a man to protect one who is placed at an
unfair disadvantage by prejudice. Cp. Sex. Rosc. § 27, eius virtute, fide,
diligentia factum est ut hic potius vivus in reos quam occisus in proscrip-
los referretur, of Caecilia, who had harboured Roscius from his enemies.
For fides in the concrete sense of a warrant of protection, we may com-
pai-e the ■^h.xz.sQ /ides publica, 3. &apos;passport.&apos; 5. sine vestro ac sine
talium virorum subsidio : the statement might be purely general — * no

But in many passages in Cicero tales viri or hi tales viri denotes thc
jury sitting for the time being {Quinct. §§53, 81 ; Sex. Rosc. § 54 ; Divin.
in Caec. § 51 ; Verr. ii. i. 10 ; cp. dc Orat. ii. § 364, de donio, § 3) ; and
the presumption from usage is strong in favour of another rendering,
&apos; without your aid, that is, without the aid of this honour^ble court. &apos;
§ 95, &apos; sine vestra sapientia ac sine iudiciorum remediis &apos; is very similar.
Ac appends a nearer definition of vcstro : cp. its use in Livy&apos;s * viri
ac Romani &apos; (vii. 13. 9; xxii. 14. ii). The repetition of the preposition
need not be a difficulty — cp. § 4, in aliqua perniciosissima flamma atqzie in

vellet . . . labefactabit . . . extorquebit . . . &apos; Convellere is to pluck
away by a straight pull ; labefactare, to shake an object backwards and
forwards, and so loosen its hold of anything to which it may be attached ;
extorqtiere is to wrench out by a twist. Thus if we wished to pull a
stake from the ground, we should first attempt &apos; convellere &apos;; if this failed
we should proceed * labefactare &apos; ; and finally, if still unsuccessful, &apos; ex-
torquere.&apos; The same processes would be applied if we wished to deprive
a person by violence of anything which he was grasping firmly (compre-
hendebat). In the next clause remittatis means &apos; let go your hold &apos;
(Ramsay). The separate force of the words is well given : but there is
no climax in the verbs, convello being fully as forcible a term as extorqueo :
and Professor Nettleship notes that convello and labefacto are nearly
synonymous in Rab. Perd. § 3, cum cuncta auxilia reipublicae labefactari
convellique videat. 30. ne repugnetis : dependent onpostulo (1. 24),

We need not, with Kiihner, consider this an instance of a Pres. Subj.
2d Person, expressing a prohihition io a definite person or persons.
This is a common construction in the Comic Poets, occurs once in Hor.
[Serin. ii. 3. 88, ne sis patruus mihi), and once only (in a more than doubt-
ful case — cp. Cluent. § 30, 1. 21), in Cic. {ad Att. xiv. i, tu quaeso, quic-
quid novi, scribere ne pigrere), but is otherwise unknown. Tlie same
rule holds as to the Pres. Subj. 2d Person of command to a definite
l^erson : it is only thus used in the Comedians and in Cicero&apos;s Letters,
c.g. ad Att. i. 17. II, te si expectari veHs, cures ut sciam. From the
instances given, it is plain that in both cases this exceptional usage was
colloquial, and not permitted in strict writing. R. 1600, n., r. 668, a.

a negative sentence, where English requires an adversative particle,
Latin frequently uses the copulative et, que, ac, atque. By the use of
Ihe latter the two sentences are placed upon the same footing : the
former would be corrective, superseding the first by the second. Sull.

32. dicam et dlluam, Indicatives, as peroraro, p. 3, 1. 2 ; although the force
oipostulo extends to these dependent clauses, the Indic. is irregularly used :
this is sometimes the case where the oratio obliqua depends on a verb in
the first person, § 158 n. ; de Fin. i. § 53, concedo . . cadere causa, si
qui aliter existimant. This is the virtual explanation of the mood oipotucro,
p. 3, 1. 14. For the combination of verbs cp. Verr. a. pr. § 33, dicendo
ac dikiendis criminibus contendere. 33. sint : the mood contrasts
with that of erit praeteritum, p, 3, 1. 2. It is to be explained (without
regard to the obhque petition ne . . subiciatis of which it forms a part)
as signifying &apos; hypothetical &apos; as opposed to * definite and particular &apos; objec-
tions : while in the Indic. below Cicero&apos;s modesty admits that he would
make actual omissions. 33. taciti cogitationi vestrae subiciatis

. . . [animo] requiratis : Classen notes, &apos;■Aniino requirere nihil aliud esl,
quam quod modo dixerat ; tacitum cogitationi subiicere : quod enim inter
ipsam defensionem iudices facerevetuitorator, id ut faciant absoluta oratione
hortatur.&apos; The identity of the expressions can scarcely be made out.
The former of the two refers to any daniaging fact which might occur to
the listener&apos;s mind traversing the point which the orator had just made :
the latter to the explanation of this fact which upon a retrospect of the
speech the same listener might seek in vain. A concrete example may
set the matter in a clearer light. Cicero alleges, as one of two probablc
motives which led Oppianicus to attempt the murder of Chientius, his wish
to possess himself of the property of the latter, an object which was to be
consummated by the supplementary murder of his own wife Sassia, to
whom it would pass by will. The juror might call up in thought (tacitus
subicere) an adverse fact — O. would not gain, by Cluentius&apos; murder and
its supplement, his alleged object — the possession of his property. For
there woukl remain two reversionary heirs (Cluentia, her daughter by
Cluentius the elder, and, in the second place, her daughter by A. Aurius
Melinus, who is mentioned in § 179). Cicero asks him to note the missing
link in the argument (requirere) at the close, instead of nientally interfer-
ing with his argument as he develops it : that is (in the case supposed),
to cast about for some explanation that might have been offered — such
as, that a murder more or less was nothing to O., and he was prepared to
send Sassia&apos;s heirs after her — and to note that it was not ofiered (animo
requirere). If animo adds anything to the sense, it must express this
evolution of a hypothesis in the juror&apos;s mind, which he seeks in vain in
the orator&apos;s defence ; v. crit. n. 33. taclti, of thought unexpressed :
here applied to the personal subject, in p. 3, I. 6, to the thing : so Balb. § 2,
&apos; opinio tacita vestrorum animorum &apos; is opposed to &apos; perspicua admiratio &apos;, :

use of the pronounor pronominal adverb (illa 1. 21, sicl. 22) to anticipate
a dependent sentence (which serves as its epexegesis) is very idiomatic : it
gives rhetorical emphasis and distinctness, indicating as it does at the
outset the course which the sentence will take. The degree of emphasis
varies according to the context. Examples from this speech are id antici-
pating Acc. and Inf./§ 138 init. : zVque, ut facerem (oblique petition) § 49
fin. : hoc followed by ut in the Subj., by Acc. and Inf. (here less empha-

IV. 9. — 30. iudicium, &apos;jury&apos;; v. Glossary. 31. quo as a final
particle ( = ut eo) is rare except in conjunction with a comparative
(as in quominus). Still it does occur without a comparative in the best
Latin : and is common in Salhist, e.g. Cat. 23, nos arma neque contra
patriam cepisse neque quo pericukim aliis faceremus, where v. Mr. Cook&apos;s
note for other exx. : Ter. Andr. 472 ; § 140, quo animiillorum iudicum . . .

quo fortissimum civem in invidiam vocaret : Verr. ii. i. 17, cum iste

retardarent. In the present instance, the words recur with little altera-
tion in the subscriptio of the censor L. GelHus, § 131, &apos;quod is pecuniam
accepisset, quo innocentem condemnaret. &apos; They are evidently a remin-
iscence of the lex Cornelia quoted in § 148, &apos; quo quis iudicio pub-

31. Statium Albium Oppianicum. Cp. § 65. 33. This is a good
example of what the rhetoricians called partitio : and as such it is
quoted by Quintilian (iv. 5. Ii), who says that some criticised this
division on the ground that it would have been enough for Cicero to
establish his third point (iudicium illud pecunia esse temptatum . . .
contra&apos;Cluentium) without proving the two former points. But the truth
is that the third point is established by the help of the former two.

32. atrocitatis, &apos;virulence.&apos; Atrox (connected with ater as celox with ^**^
celer) must have meant originally, &apos; duU leaden black &apos; (a fast colour) ;

cp. atra tempestas, ater Cocytos : niger meaning &apos;glossy black.&apos; In
many of its applications the idea of persistence is prominent, e.g. Plaut.
Capt. 534 (Ussing), nisi reperio atrocem mihi aliquam astutiam, of
defiantly &apos;brazening it out&apos; [&apos;some double-dyed contrivance,&apos; comically
serious. — H. N.]: Hor. C. ii. i. 24, praeter atrocem animum Catonis,

is the sense of atrocitas here. 33. innocentem pecunia circumventum,

attendant circumstances : cp. Brut. § 164, nulla est altercatio clamoribus
umquam habita maioribus : &apos; on more heinous charges, or charges better
attested.&apos; 2. praeiudicia: &apos;previous judgments&apos; ; &apos;judgments which
form precedents.&apos; So Asconius on Divin. § 12 explains the word —
praeiudicium dicitur res, quae cum statuta fuerit, adfert iudicaturis
exemplum quod sequantur. The meaning &apos; prejudice &apos; is post-classical.
4. non modo {non) ab isdem, sed ne ab aliis quidem. The negative
after non modo {non sohim) may be omitted when there is a negative in the
latter member of the sentence, and also a predicate common to both
members, but expressed (with the negative) in the latter of the two only.
Cp. § 89, non modo causae, sed ne legi quidem quicquam . . . -laxamenti
datum est : § 178. Liv. i. 40, advenam non modo vicinae sed ne Italicae
quidem stirpis ( = qui non modo . . . stirpis esset). The force of the
expressed negative extends to the former member of the sentence. R.

Rosc. Am. § 85, praeest huic quaestioni vir et contra audaciam fortissimus

Cicero and the Comedians use it. Ni generally introduces, with them, a
negative condition, nisi an exception. Cp. the use of ni in a sponsio or
wager, e.g. Plaut. Epid. 698, ni ergo raatris filiast | in meum nummum,
in tuum talentum pignus da, &apos; bet me a talent to my drachma, if she is
not . . .,&apos; i.e. *I will bet you a drachma to a talent that she is . . .&apos;
Though &apos; an exception often has the effect of a negative condition,&apos; and
though later writers, such as Livy, neglect the distinction between 7zisi
and ni, an original distinction in sense exists, as the following passage
shows— Cic. Offi. iii. § 113, decem illi, quos iuratos ad senatum misit

applied to the indignant grief of the woman.

sense of &apos; deception to one&apos;s hurt.&apos; — H. J. R.] illa aetas = homines

illius aetatis. An instance of &apos; res pro persona &apos; or abstract for concrete.
The original and most frequent case of this usage is that in which the
Genitive of the person is subjoined —

virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli

(as if we had here hominum illa aetas : cp. Sest&apos;. § 88, huic gravitati
hominis). Lastly we have the Abstract Subst. used alone and unquali-
fied for the concrete : as in the locus classicus, Catil. ii. § 25, ex hac parte
pudor pugnat, illinc petulantia cet. 28. cominuni dolore muliebri,

&apos; the anguish which any woman so cruelly wronged by a husband would
feel &apos; : communis contrasts the general rule with the particular case. Cp.

reference to pellexit (1. 26).

14. — 33. Ecce autem : used in a colloquial style ; marks vividly a
transilion to a fresh inference, or (as here) to a startling incident,
So § 75, ecce tibi eiusmodi sortitio ; Verg. A. ii. 203, ecce autem

conducted on the evening of the marriage day by the pronuba (in this
case Sassia, her mother), after she had retired from the bridal feast.
Rich. Dict. Antiq., lectus p. 375. — Not merely this, but it would seem
that the mother actually prepared the lectus genialis in the atrium on the
day of her daughter&apos;s marriage : v. Ov. Heroid. viii. 95, nec pacta

tiarum auspices declarant, qui re omissa nomen tantum tenent.&apos; Thus
at this time there was no actual taking of auspices. The old name sur-
vived : but the * auspex &apos; merely acted as witness to the signature of the
marriage settlement (tabulae legitimae). So Juvenal {Sat. x. 335), in
describing the preparations for the marriage of Messalina with Silius, has
the words—

ritu decies centena dabuntur
antiquo, veniet cum signatoriliis auspex,

and Suet. Claud. 26 on the same event : * quam cum comperisset C.
Silio etiam nupsisse dote inter auspices consignata supplicio adfecit.&apos;^
nuUis auctoribus : &apos; According to Roman law a woman was never
regarded as completely sui iuris. She was always in potestate parentis
or in inanu viriox in tutela. Hence, strictly speaking, she could perform
no legal act without the sanction of her husband or of her guardian, as
Ihe case might be, and the person or persons who gave this sanction be-
came Auctor or Auctores of the transaction &apos; : (Ramsay, who quotes
Liv. xxxiv. 2, maiores nostri nullam, ne privatam quidem, rem agerc
feminas sine auctore voluerunt : in manu esse parentum fratrum virorum).
So too a son subject \.o patria potestas cannot marry without an auctor,
who will be his father : he must marry de consensu patris. Scst. § 6, qu
(sc. patre) auctore duxit . . . C. Albini filiam. Ter. Adelph. 670,

Zumpt conjectures very plausibly that Sergius had by this maltreatment of
Aurius made himself amenable to a certain clause of the lex Comelia de
sicariis et veneficis, to which Apuleius alludes thus — * prudens crimen
Corneliae legis incurram, si civem Romanum pro servo tibi vendidero &apos;
{^Metam. viii. 24). The offence was known to Roman lawyers as
^ plagiutn&apos;&apos; or &apos; kidnapping,&apos; and there was a lex Fabia, passed some little
time before B.C. 100, which dealt with it. Sulla probably embodied one
of its clauses in his Statute on Murder, dealing only with those who
enslaved a free Roman citizen, and inflicting the capital penalty, whereas

the penalty under the lex Fabia varied according to the circumstances of
the offender and his victim. We have another instance of &apos; plagium &apos;
in § 162. Cp. Zumpt, ii. 2. 36 : Mr. Heitland, _pro Rabir. appendix d.
9. inter sicarlos damnari : similar expressions are quaestio (§ 147),
iudicium, inter sicarios : inter sicarios deferre, accusare, defendere. There
was no substantive to denote the crime which came under Sulla&apos;s law &apos; de
sicariis &apos;: and this clumsy expression supplied the deficiency. Cp. Rosc. Am.
§ 90, qui inter sicarios et de veneficiis accusabant. Inier sicarios deferre
is commonly explained as an abbreviation of ita deferre ut nomen alicuius
inter sicarios referatur — &apos; to accuse a man as being among the number of
assassins&apos; : quaestio i. s. would be &apos; a judicial inquiry as to those who are
thus numbered.&apos; But the expressions inter lignarios (Liv. xxxv. 41),
inter falcarios {Catil. i. § 8), meaning respectively &apos; in Joiner Street,&apos;

* in or to Scythemaker Street &apos; (as we might say), seem to suggest
that inter sica7&apos;ios is a quasi-local designation, applied attributively to
quaestio first, &apos; the Assassination-Court &apos; ; then used with verbs, * to accusc
or defend in the Assassination-Court,&apos; qnaestione being understood.
sicarius is simply &apos;murderer,&apos; the later homicida ; it is by no means
limited to the sense of &apos; professional assassin, &apos; or that of &apos; one who uses
the sica or short dagger,&apos; the stiletto of that day (although the word used
is characteristic of the times in which this Statute on Murder was
drafted) : accordingly Quint. defines &apos; sicarii &apos; as &apos; qui caedem telo
quocumque commiserint,&apos; telum again being defined by the lawyers as

* quod mittitur manu,&apos; and in fact denoting every offensive weapon.

in agreement by a kind of attraction, for ab hoc tempore, ab illo tempore,
respectively. Only the context decides whether the time is reckoned
before Or after the given date : as is seen by comparing Vetr. iv. § 39,
paucis illis diebus, meaning &apos; a few days before that time,&apos; with the last
preceding example.

33. Who is this A. Aurius ? Two passages, . § 25, Aurium illum
. . . et alterum Aurium et eius L. filium ; and § 11, A. Aurio Melino
. . . adulescenti in primis, ut tum habebatur, inter suos et honesto
et nobili, must be compared, together with § 26, Sassiam . . . cuius
virum A. Aurium occiderat, before we endeavour to answer this question.
A. Aurius has been confidently identified by Classen with A. Aurius
MeUnus, whom we know Oppianicus to have murdered (§ 26). He
argues : {a) that A, Aurius Melinus vmsf have been one of the three
Aurii put to death together (§ 25): {b) that he cannot be the &apos;alter
Aurius &apos; who had a full-grown son, for in § 1 1 he is called adulescens,
which is applicable to &apos; a man of 30 to 40 years of age, but not upwards.&apos;
And the father of such a son must have been over 40. {c) Therefore
A. Aurius Melinus is to be identified with A. Aurius here. There are
one or two weak points in this. We have no right to assume (a) : Sylvius
may be right in suspecting that A. Aurius Melinus was murdered at
some other time : we do not necessarily know every Aurius and Auria
then in existence, and their pedigree ; e.g. Oppianicus&apos; brother was
married to an Auria otherwise unknown (§ 31). But if we assume
that Melinus was one of the three Aurii proscribed, we may, with Ramsay,
dispute (/&gt;). L. Aurius may have been a mere child of four or five, the issue
of the marriage of A. Aurius Melinus with Cluentia : even if this be not so,
he may have been the son of a previous marriage of Melinus (vvhich might
be easily assumed) ; Melinus might thus be still &apos; adulescens &apos; in the sense
assigned by Classen. But the word cannot be thus limited in its applica-
tion. If then Melinus is the &apos; alter Aurius,&apos; A. Aurius is a distinct person
introduced for t/ie /Irst time. The language of the passage seems to

support this view. Moreover Cicero &apos; never would have spoken so
respectfully — vir fortis et experiens — of the incestuous husband of Sassia,
whom he (§ II ad fin.) characterises simply as an adtdescens of excellent
character at the tiine of his union with Ckientia.&apos; A. Ckientius the elder
died B.C. 88 : his daughter married A. Aurius Mdinus shortly after
{brevi te^npore), and was divorced in two years&apos; time (§§ ii, 14). Thus
there was ample time for the loss of A. Aurius Melinus&apos; good name

dent verbs. So with priiisquam and dmn, as in the famous &apos; rusticus ex-
spectat dum defluat amnis &apos; (Hor. Ep. i. 2. 42). R. 1672, r. 698. &apos; The next

28. — 22. quisquam is not irregular here : it is implied that no one oi
Oppianicus&apos; household brought the news : in fact the sentence is quasi-
negative. Cp. Sen. Ep. 17. 6, hoc prius quaere quam quicquam.
Caiil. i. g 6, quamdiu quisquam erit qui te defendere audeat, vives —
implying a doubt that there will be any one of the kind. Quisqnatu
means &apos; any single one,&apos; &apos;any whatever,&apos; &apos; where all are excluded, or
the barest minimum is sufficient to justify an affirmative&apos; (R. 2278,
r. 898) : quivis and quilibet, &apos; any one you will &apos; where all are inckided.
The rule that quisquani is only used in negative and quasi-negative
sentences is in the vast majority of cases true : but there are some
exceptions, especially in Livy : e.g. xxv. 6. 17, nos, quibus, nisi quod
commisimus ut quisquam ex Cannensi acie miles Romanus superesset, nihil
obici potest : &apos; we are to ])lame that any single soldier survived the field

and her money : nothing has been said of any hopes entertained by Sassia.&apos;
But the next sentence evidently contrasts the spirit in which Sassia noiu
closed with the offer of Oppianicus with the spirit in which (according to
§ 27, 1. 7-10) she had previously spurned it. .&apos;Now in high spirits and
strongly re-assured by her prospects. &apos; 30. quod, &apos; whereas, &apos; serves to
contrast opposites, especially, according to Classen, where of a certain
number the remainder are opposed to oiie or a feiu who are excepted.
So § 190, ita quod apud ceteros . . . haec mulier . . . putavit. V. crit. n.

necesse erat, naturae concessit. 9. &apos; You hear facts which might be
treated at the greatest length, treated by me briefly and superficially. &apos;
Strictim is connected with stringo (akin to arpojyy^iw^ &apos;strangle&apos;):
which has two main senses, &apos;to draw tight or fast,&apos; &apos; to graze the sur-
face.&apos; (P^or the connection of the ideas, cp. in English &apos;fast,&apos; &apos;fast
by&apos;). Strictim accordingly denotes {a) &apos;compactly,&apos; {b) &apos;passing over
the surface,&apos; &apos;cursorily.&apos; Cicero uses many such adverbs in -//-&apos;/,
expressing the viode of action, e.g. pedetemptim (§ 118), summatim (§ 19,
= per summas loquendo, &apos; taking the prominent points&apos;), separatim
(§ 64), nominatim (§ 185), acervatim (§ 30, = per acervas tractando,
&apos; taking the facts in the gross &apos;). R. 533, 534, r. 227. The sym-
metrical arrangement of the members of the contrasted wholes, vos . . .
dicuntur, illi . . . diceretur, must be noticed. As vos atiditis is taken
up by atcditis, so is illi atuiiebant by audiehant : and the articulation
of the main sentences on either side corresponds. But each of the
former clauses has a magnified reflection in each of the latter clauses :
thus to &apos; de eo in quem iudices non estis &apos; answers &apos; de eo de quo iurati
sententias ferre debebant.&apos; And thus with &apos;et {elra, &apos;after that&apos;&apos;) est
quisquam . . . &apos; we can fancy the orator&apos;s clenched hand fall on the table
before him, as he indignantly demands, &apos; Will any one now declare that
the jury which condemned Oppianicus condemned an innocent man?&apos;
ending with scornful emphasis upon the word innocentem, il. con-
sceleratum, strengthened form of sceieratum : cp. decet and condecet,
cado and concido, dignus and condignus. * Guilt-stained. &apos; 12. We cannot
press any supposed imperfect sense of oderant in order to save the credit of
Cicero&apos;s advocacy, which may to us seem injudicious in this naive admis-
sion that the jury hated the man on whose guilt or innocence they had to
pronounce. Ramsay would do so, explaining, *they were gradually
becomingfilled with detestation of his reckless villany, and were arriving

at the conclusion that he was omni supplicio dignus.&apos; But what of the
Imperfects debebant, intuebantur^which must be treated in the same way,
to the ruin of the sense? \^Oderant is a pluperfect : &apos; they had got into
the state of dislike and now did actually dislike him.&apos; — H. J. R.] The
truth is, as a piece of Roman advocacy the words do not require an apology.
Cp. n. on p. 7, 1. 15. omni supplicio, &apos;every kind of punishment&apos;:
cp. Sest, § 75, omni mora, Sest. § 94, quibus omne supplicium atque
omnis iure optimo poena del)etur : and in the Plural, Sest. § 39,
quocum mihi omnes erant amicitiae necessitudines. Thus omnis some-
\\mQ.&apos;s, = omnigeniis, as Tras = Traj/Totos. For another use oi omnis, cp. n. on
g. I. 15. P. Cannutio : mentioned in the Brutus (§ 205), Sulpici
orationes quae feruntur, eas post mortem eius scripsisse P. Cannutius
putatur, aequalis meus, homo extra nostrum ordinem meo iudicio diser-
tissimus. audiebant cum . . . diceretur : contrast supr. 1. 8, auditis
cum . . . dicuntur : a good iUustration of the tendency of the Romans
to put a past tense after cutn in the subj., while yet retaining the indic.
for the present. The imperf. &apos;audivi cum diceretur,&apos; &apos; I heard it said,&apos; is
common in Cicero. (R. 1714, r. 726.) [The pres. subj. &apos;soleo audire
cum dicat^ is found in Orat. i. § 129; I know no other instance of the
indic. in this form of expression. But I see no objection to dicuntur in
itself,— H. J. R.]

of liuiusce causae, cp. n. on § 2, 1. 15 [coniunctio). 2.1. teneatis

colloquial Latin. Cp. n. on § 6. It is dependent on quaeso : cp.
itsusein §§8, 11, with a Subj. introduced by a final particle, R. 1596,
1606, r. 668, 672. Cp. § 135, tu, Acci, consideres censeo. 28. emori,
V. crit. n. &apos; Cried aloud that she was dying in the utmost pain.&apos; 30. ad,

V. n. on p. 34, 1. 19. voces morientis, &apos; her dying cries &apos; ; and in 1. 32
&apos; her dead body. &apos; The Latin compares favourably with the English in
the logical precision which assigns the epithet to the person instead of
the thing.

XI. 31. — Page 12, 1. 2. parricidium: theorigin of this term was dis-
puted even in ancient times. In Cic. its meaning is : (i) &apos;the murder
of a parent&apos;; (2) &apos;the murder of a kinsman&apos;; (3) treason against one&apos;s
country, the common parent, Sull. § 6, patriae parricidium. But it
is asserted that at the most remote period it also denotes &apos;murder&apos;
pure and simple ; in proof of which the following passage is quoted : —
parricidi quaestores appellabantur, qui solebant creari causa rerum
capitalium quaerendarum. Nam parricida non utique is, qui parentem
occidisset, dicebatur, sed qualemcumque hominem indemnatum. Ita

HOMINEM LIBERUM DOLO SCIENS MORTI DUIT, PARICIDAS ESTO (Paul.

Diac. after Fest. p. 221 M.). And accordingly we find Priscian, i. § 33,
apparently preferring to derive the word from parem, caedo : whereas
the ancients generally derived it from patrem^ caedo. So too modern
.scholars have (a) either connected it with pater, or (^) taking as original
the meaning &apos; murder with malice aforethought &apos; {dolo sciens), have sug-
gested the root irapa, Skt. para, Lat. perperam. The latter view (at any
rate as regards the meaning) is that of Mommsen, Hist. i. p. 158
Eng. tr., Rdiu. Staatsr. \\.&apos;^ p. 528. Rein {CriminalrecJit, p. 450),
objecting to the vowel-change assumed in the derivation from para,
also considers * murder of a parent &apos; to be the original meaning.
The words of Paul. l.c.y may well be explained, &apos; let every murderer
be regarded in the same light and punished by the same law, as if
]ic were an actual parricide.&apos; This would seem to be Ramsay&apos;s view ;
his interesting note shoukl be consulted. 3. &apos; To pave the way to

this abominable crime, he secuired his approaches by other guilty deeds.&apos;
The metaphor is taken from pioneering or road-making : cp. leg. agr. ii.
§17, viam sibi ad beneficium impetrandum munire ; not dissimilar is the
metaphor in leg. agr. i. § 27, honori velificari suo &apos; to make sail for,&apos; i.e.
gain an advantage for. The term wz^ w/r^ ( &apos; fortify &apos;) oi making a road,
well expresses the compact structure of the Roman road, which was
always military in its main purpose, and was built to last : v. Rich,
Antiquities, articles via, agger. 8. poculo mortis : mortis = morti-

ferum. But the Gen. of quahty without an epithet is very rare ; and mors

not, from whatever cause, take the property. A heres sectmdus was in
fact a heres substitutus : there might also be a heres substitutus tertio,
quarto, gradu, and so on. Cp. Hor. Serm. ii. 5. 48, of a legacy-hunter :

19. damno is construed most commonly with either the Gen. or Abl. of
the charge or the penalty : § 114, damnatos ambitus : § 19, criminibus
(lamnatus. The Gen. of the penalty is all but confined, however, to the
words capitis, pecuniae^ capitalis poenae. R. 1325 and 1200, r. 527, 495.

XII. 33. — 31. adMMtis amicis : a good illustration of a principle which
runs through much Roman law, public as well as private. A magistrate or
a paterfamilias is legally competent in virtue of his potestas to give a cer-
tain decision or perform a certain act without the participation of others.
But he is held to be morally bound, on important occasions, not to act
until he has taken the advice of competent persons, who, called in to ad-
vise, constitute his consilium. Thus for a certain class of actions, the
magistrate must advise with the senate as the puhlicum consilium : the
jury {cojisilium) in a criminal process stands technically in the same
relation to the praetor or quaesitor : similarly in important domestic acts,
such as divorce or the capital punishment of a son, relations and friends of
the house appear to have been summoned to givc thcir ad\ icc. In leg. agr.

law to give to agrarian commissioners, Cic. says — orbis terrarum gentium-
que omnium datur cognitio sine consilio. Page 13, 1. i. tum : for by
the death of Num. Magius the tie of adfinitas was, according to Roman law
and feeling, dissolved. So infr. p. 15, I. 21, Sest. § 6, ademit Albino soceri
nomen mors filiae (ubi v. Holden). 2. id quod conceperat. Cp. n.
on liberos, § 31. The Indicative in indirect speech is not unfrequent
where the clause containing it is merely explanatory or contains a truth
for which the writer or speaker himself, and not the reported speaker, is
responsible : when in fact it is insulated. This is frequent in Livy : e.g.
xxi. 27. 4 ; duces Galli edocent . . . insulae circumfusum amnem latiore,
ubi dividebatur, eoque minus alto alveo transitum ostendere. 4. Here
si qui natus erit (instead of the more regular esset) is an extract from the
will, left out of construction with regard to the rest of the sentence. The
same diction appears in more than one place of the Digest : si quis mihi
ex eo nepos sive neptis natus nata erit. legat grandem pecuniam a
filio : fearing that the woman might procure abortion for herself. * No
legatum could be bequeathed except throiigh a Heres, or as it was techni-
cally expressed ab herede, who was bound to pay it,&apos; Ramsay, R. Ant.
p. 263. Cp. the phrase solvere ab aHquo, to pay out of funds supplied by
some one ; ad Att. vii. 18. 4, Q. frater laborat ut tibi quod debet ab

down&apos; or &apos; in advance,&apos; repraesentat : cp. the metaphorical expression
at the end of Phil. ii., si repraesentari morte mea Hbertas civitatis
potest, &apos; secured immediately.&apos; 12. si haec solutio . . . est, an
attraction for /^^^ ; &apos;a demonstrative orrelative pronoun, used substantively
as the subject of a definition, is usually attracted into the gender and number
of the defining substantive,&apos; R. 1068, r. 451. Cp. § 96, vis illa fuit ;

35. — 18. obtestatione viri . . . nosse debuit : the Abl. of cause (where
it is not a mere variety of the instrumental abl.) generaHy denotes the
motive, that is, a cause lying within the subject or agent. It is rarely that
it denotes a cause lying outside the agent, except in certain formulas,
causa, gratia, macte virtute esto, substantives in u which have no other
case (iussu, rogatu, etc). Such a case we have in Phil. i. 30, se bene-
ficio novo memoriam veteris doloris abiccisse, and in thc prcsent i^assage.

the length of the old year, was the regular period of gestation, as the
Romans believed : and for teu months too (not Jive) a widow mourned
her husband&apos;s death. Graevius quotes Ov. Fastz, i. 33 —

XIII. 36. — 23. &apos;Of Asuvius of Larinum&apos; . the difference between
the Latin and English idiom is noticeable : so pugna Cannensis, aliena
negotia : v. Brad]ey&apos;s Arnold, § 58. Larino, abl. of origin used

attributively ; which is not an uncommon idiom in earher Latin, but rare
in Cicero and Caesar. V. Exx. in R. 1264 (r. 512). It is invariably
used, however, in giving the name of the tribe : e.g. Phil. ix. 15, Ser.
Sulpicius Q. f. Lemonia Rufus. 25. perdita nequitia et summa
egestate : apte coniunguntur, nequitiam enim, id est sumtus immoderatos,

upon Asuvius, and through him lay successful siege to the young man
and carry his ancestral fortunes by storm.&apos; 30. sperare se . . . ex-

6. longum est : we say &apos; it ivould be tedious. &apos; In phrases such as longum
est, fuit satius, aequius erat, utilius fuerat, expressive of duty or power,
Latin prefers to state the absolute existence of the duty or power at a
certain time, irrespective of conditions which in fact limited its exercise,
using the indicative : English, less logical, conditions it by such fact, and
uses the potential. Sest. § 12, longum est ea dicere : sed hoc breve
dicam. R. 1535, r. 643.

37. — 8. mulierculaui, &apos;mistress&apos;: the Diminutive is contemptuous ;
cp. yvvaiov (Plut. Themist. xxvi. § 3) ; yvvaLKdpia ceawpevjxha d^aprtais
(S. PauFs Ep. ad Tim. ii. 3. 6). Cp. Graecuhis esuriens, plebecula,
rumusculi (§ 105) ; lacrimula {Planc. § 76), &apos;a crocodile-tear.&apos; But some-
times the force of the Diminutive is good-humoured : § 72, aliquid
speculae, &apos;some glimmer of hope&apos;: gloriola nostra i^Fam. v. 12. 9).
These divergent applications may be iHustrated freely from Cicero&apos;s
lctters : contrast Tulliola (Cicero&apos;s daughter) with Pulchelhis (Clodius).
In the famous lines of Hadrian to the soul, beginning &apos;animula
vagula blandula,&apos; a pathetic force is given. In horttili {infr. 1. 15),
&apos; pleasure-grounds &apos; seems to render the effect best ; servulus (§ 175),
&apos;a favourite slave&apos;: in many cases it is more easily felt than expressed.

Catullus. V. Nagelsb. StiL § 46. 11. obsignatores, &apos;qui esta-

14. brevi illo tempore, v. n. on § 22, 1. 26. 15. hortulos,

cp. n. on 1. 14. It is plain from de Off. iii. § 58 that horti and hortuli
can be used indifferently of the same pleasure-grounds. The singular
and phiral differ in meaning : the latter, &apos; a pleasure-ground &apos; (cp.
horti Sallustiani, h. Maecenatis, at Rome) ; the former, &apos;a kitchen-
garden.&apos; 15. harenarias, &apos; excavations made for the purpose of obtaining
Ihe volcanic sand now called &quot; pozzuolana. &quot; This has been extensively
used for building purposes from a very remote epoch, and thus the ahiiost

of early Christian worship and burial : cp. Prudentius, Trepi (jTecf^aviav :

of the higher magistrates. (a) Thus, as commissioners of police, they
assisted the aediles : in this capacity they patrolled and kept order in
the streets, arresting and summarily punishing disorderly characters
(Hor. £j)od. iv. ii, sectus flagellis hic triumviralibus) : and also
superintending all precautions against fire. {d) In the other important
branch of their functions they are the subordinates of the praetors
(with whom, for the earlier period, we must here associate the
consuls as judicial officers). (i) In criminal jurisdiction they have no
independent powers : they may arrest accused persons and detain them
till a higher magistrate interferes : they may entertain at their tribunal,
the Columna Maenia in the Forum (near the common prison), any accusa-
tion preferred, and set an investigation on foot. (This we find Q. Manlius
doing in the present case. ) They are also (like our Sheriffs) responsible
for the execution of a capital sentence : in the case of private execution
by strangling, they are themselves the proper execulioners : so in the case
of the Catilinarian conspirators, Sall. Cat. 55. Hence their title capitales.
(2) In civil jurisdiction the triumvirs were competent to try certain cases
remitted to them, with instructions, by the praetor acting in iure as it
was called. But they could not pass a capital sentence : and the quaes-
tiones perpetuae in course of time absorbed their judicial functions.^

to be pressed. The account in §§ 21, 22 must be compared : we learn
that Dinaea survived her children, M. Aurius, Cn, Magius, and Oppiani-
cus&apos; wife Magia. M. Aurius and a kinsman, A. Aurius, were made away

of Larinum. Originally the census of the whole burgess body of
the Roman State was conducted by a central authority, the Roman
Censors ; before whom each citizen registered himself in person. When
this became impossible in practice, the censors employed delegates,
who collected the names of Roman citizens serving abroad. Liv.
xxix. 37, 5 : lustrum condittim seritis, quia per provincias dimiserunt
ce7isores, itt civium Romano7&apos;um in exercitibus quantns ubique essei
refer7&apos;etur nu??ierus. But with the growth of the niunicipal system in
Italy, decentralisation went forward ; and even before the enfranchise-
ment of Italy in b.C. 90-89, which stereotyped it, each municipium had
its own censors. The Roman censors determined the time and procedure
of the census on each occasion : the municipal censors held it by their
mandate. This appears in the lex lulia of B.c. 45, quae tntmicipia . . .

peated, always in a different case or case and gender. He refers also to

We may observe that with this device we have the simple Anaphora (of
nemo and omnes) here combined : an ilhistration of the fine elaboration
of Cicero&apos;s best sentences. decuriones, senatus universus. — Man.
The council or senate of a municipium or colony was so called. Thus in
B.c. 59, Capua was constituted a colony with decuriones and dmtmviri
(the latter answering to consuls, cp, § 25, n.). In this municipal council
there were generally 100 members, divided into 10 decuries, whose
presidents constituted the decem primi so called ( Verr. ii. 2. 162).

alises. The idiom is probably colloquial. It occurs in the Letters : e.g.

&apos; my brother was good-nature itself, your sister was as surly as could be. &quot;

letter of the law,&apos; &apos;without violating statute &apos; : pie, &apos; without violating
duty.&apos; liiste, propter Opp. insidiantem vitae suae: pie, erga se ipsum,

scarcely distinguishable from that of the last construction. Liv. ii. i8.

property of an intestate, failing &apos; sui heredes &apos; (or children of his own),
passed to his co7isanguinei, i.e. brothers and sisters by the same father.
Sassia, if she married Cluentius pater with conventio in manum, would
rank (in law) as his daughter, and sister of Chientius fihus. Thus Ramsay
explains Cicero&apos;s words. But it will be objected : what had become of
Cluentia, the sister of Cluentius ? and had not Sassia passed out of the
manus of Cluentius when she married Oppianicus? The word bona
points to the mother&apos;s claims being under the praetor&apos;s edict to the
bonorui7i possessio^ i.e. to the practical enjoyment, as opposed to the
strict technical heirship [hereditas). As Cluentius had rmo children and
no father, the mother would, if he died intestate, be entitled to the bon.
poss.y if there were no brother or sister. We hear of no brother ; the
sister must be either dead or had ceased to belong to the Cluentian family
by marrying cm?i coiwe?ttione in manum (Gai. i. §§ 109, 162, 163, etc).
The mother, if she married Cluentius and passed into his maitus, would
have had claim to the hereditas and to the bon. poss., as if she had been a
daughter ; but she had married twice since, and had probably ceased to be-
long to the Cluentian family . She could thus claim only bonorum possessio,
not hereditas (succession by civil law). Cp. § 165, where the language is
more explicit. [For this explanation I am indebted to Mr. Roby.]
9. aucta, as Class. says, is Nom. case, answering to orbata. So Verr.
ii. 5. 80, hac tanta praeda auctus. 10. neearetur ; the Subj . may

be somewhat difficult. {a) A good parallel is de Or. i. § 167, alter plus
lege agendo petebat, quarri quantum lex in xii tabulis permiserat, quod
cum impetrasset, causa caderet : &apos; having obtained which, he would, or
was to, be cast on the technical point.&apos; So here, *so (he thought) she
might be, or would be, more easily killed,&apos; or &apos;intending to kill her more
easily.&apos; &apos; The imperfects express the future force of the subj. in past
time.&apos; — H. N. {b) We may however call the subj. simply hypothetical,
i.e. apodosis with protasis aucta pecunia, orbata filio : &apos;who would,
if made richer, have furnished better reward for her death, and if deprived
of her son, have been killed with less risk &apos; : R. § 1534, r. 642. One might
have expected, instead of quae . . . hecaretur, quam necari posse, so that
this would have been dependent on intellegebat. But Cic. has chosen
to put it independently [H. J. R.]. This Imperf. Subj. in past
time answers to the Pres. Subj. in present time — giving an assumption
possible at the time of its making, but falhng in the province of things
past : the case is regarded as simply imaginary (not as unfulfilled). —
An ex. in R. 1532 c. (the seventh) brings this out well : Tusc. i. § 90,
Cur igitur et Camillus doleret, si haec . . . eventura putaret, et ego
doleam, si . . . gentem aliquam urbe nostra potituram putem ? The forms

Alatrium, as in Greek ^AXiTpLov and ^AXdrpLov, was in the country of the
Hernici, a few miles to the north of the Via Latina, about ten miles due
east of Anagnia and six miles north of Ferentinum. The modern town
Alatri is chiefly interesting from the circumstance that the walls which
encompassed the ancient city and its citadel still remain almost entire,
presenting perhaps the finest and most perfect example in existence of
that very ancient and massive style of building which is now generally
termed Polygonal. Arpinum, the birthplace of Cicero, where also there
is a fine Polygonal wall, lies about sixteen miles south-east from Aletrium,
and the proximity of the two towns is alluded to in the next chapter (xvii.

ing cases where res is repeated. As he says, it began in legal and juridical
formulae in which precision is everything : he compares the redundant
language of English Acts of Parliament. It is most frequent with terms
of likely occurrence in law documents, causa, lex, dies, iudicium, locus,
cet. But it certainly is not confined to legal phraseology. Caesar,
writing, as he does, with military preciseness, is partial to it : e.g. B. G.

same as it is here : the orator fears that his self-praises may offend his
hearers. [Mr. Roby takes dicam as pres. subj., under R. 1540, r. 644 b,
or R. 1590, r. 666 a.] So Classen&apos;s note is wrong : haec non modestiae
causa Cicero adiecit, sed quod in tam turpi causa vix honestum videbatur
tantum a se esse praestitum. Cp. end of § 109.

52. — 32. ut quicquid for ut quicqtie, an archaic use which may have
held its ground in popular speech. It occurs in Lucr., e.g. i. 289, ruit
qua quicquid fluctibus obstat ; again in Cic. ad Fam. vi, i. i, quocunque
in loco quisquis est, idem est ei sensus . . . ex interitu rerum et publi-
carum et suarum. Properly quisquis is only an indefinite relative. R.
2283, r. 899. V. crit. n. apprelienderam : the perfect and plu-
perfect indicative are used in primary and historic time respectively to
denote a &apos;case frequently recurring,&apos; with quicunque, cum, ut quisque,
cet. This iterative use of these indicative tenses is universal in Cicero,
Caesar, and Sallust ; Livy and later writers have the subjunctive in
pluperfect and sometimes imperfect tenses. Verr. i. § 19, ut quisque me
viderat, narrabat. Contrast Liv. i. 32. 13, id ubi dixisset, hastam in fines
eorum emittebat. The imperfect of repeated action naturally follows this
pluperfect. R. 1716, 1717, r. 720, 721 ; Bradley&apos;s Arn. § 434. *As
fast as I laid hold of any point, the prosecutor wrenched it from my
hands.&apos; (Observe the art with which Cic. turns an awkward fact against
his own case, viz. his own defence of Scamander, into an additional argu-
ment against Oppianicus.) 33. quaesiveram, iterative again: and

egeram, p. 20, 1. 3. But usus essem, 1. 7, commoratus essem, 1. 10, are
single facts. Page 20, 1. 6. ventura fuisse, v. crit. n. for the general
sense. This periphrastic infinitive represents venissent in Oratio Recta,
the apodosis to an unfulfilled condition contained in morte Habiti ( = si
mortuus esset Habitus). R. 1784 a, r. 765 a.

53. — 13. usu venire, *occur.&apos; Venio is seldom, if ever, used abso-
lutely with a neuter subject in Cicero, except in this phrase : the only
instance in Merguet (if it is an instance) is Marcell. § 27, quod [extremum,
i.e. finis vitae\cvss\\tv\.\., omnis voluptas praeterita pro nihilo est. Usu

cause the persons denoted are regarded not as agents but as instruments.

R. 1213, 1220, r. 499. *The case broke down under the evidence of

54. — 23. re quidem vera : ^&quot; but in reality.&apos; This adversative use of

and occurs in the former member of an antithesis. We may compare
the adversative use of /xrju (a strengthened fi^v) in Greek. Cp. Sest. § 15,

An advocatus wasnot necessarily a legal adviser : it denoted generally &apos; any
friend who lent his aid, countenance, or advice,&apos; attending in court during
the trial. Cp. Pseudo-Asconius on Cic. Div. in Caec. § 20, qui defendit
alterum in iudicio aut patronus dicitur, si orator est, aut advocatus si aut
ius suggerit aut praesentiam sua??i commodat amico. So in Hor. Serm. i. 9.
38 (the Bore), &apos; Si me amas,&apos; inquit, * paulum hic ades,&apos; * inteream si aut
valeo stare aut novi civilia iura,&apos; i.e. &apos;I cannot simply appear (stare =
adesse), much less give professional advice.&apos; Mr. Peterson quotes Cic.
Pkil. i. 16, vellem adesset Antonius, modo sine advocatis ; Dem. de Cor.
275. 20, ol iK wapaKXrjcrecjs avyKad-^fjievoi. Advocatio denotes &apos;not only
the act of calling upon friends for assistance in judicial matters, but also
the time alloxved to a defendant to prepare for his trial : advocationes
postulare [adFam. vii. 11), &quot; to demand postponements.&quot; &apos; — Ry. There is
a third sense : &apos; the body of supporters thus called in&apos;; advocatio toga-

the jury should vote openly or secretly. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 298.

the presiding judge said &apos; Amplius,&apos; and fixed a day for a second hearing

truth. The same process was repeated, with fresh pleading and fresh
evidence : and if the jury were still undecided, a fresh adjournment
(ampliatio) might be made. The process was repeated until a positive
verdict was obtained. Ry. Rom. Ant. pp. 299, 300 should be consulted,

58. — 4. We may observe the transition from the periodic to the
detached style — the latter, as frequently, being characterised by much
asyndeton. This often occurs where a narrative is to be given. The
events, instead of being grouped by subordination of clauses, are co-
ordinated, their connection and relative importance being indicated,
in the main, simply by the order of their recital. Thus the verbs fall
singly like the strokes of a hammer : ^ the general impression left upon
the mind is that of a drama very rapidly enacted, or proceeding by steady
movement to a catastrophe ; or it is that of a story accurately exhibited in
its details, to conciHate acceptance. [The same style appears in argument
and refutation : e.g. in the ^ altercationes &apos; ; cp. §§ 61, 63, 90, 91. So in
Sull. §§ 53-55.] With the present narration we may cp. Rosc. Am. §§ 59,
60, a description of a scene in court ; Cat. iii. §§ 10, il. The student
should read Dr. Potts&apos; Hints, Part iv. Ch. vii., &apos;On the Limitations

the predicate or attribute of the subject expressed is common thereto with
a subject unexpressed save in the context : e.g. xxi. 17. 7, CorneUo minus

each case the words in question are equivalent to a very strong etiam. — Et

rather expect accusatori. Strictly speaking, the word is improperly used
here. It should signify, of the prosecutor, &apos; to make terms with the de-
fence&apos; from corrupt motives, instead of prosecuting in earnest. Cp.
Plin. Ep. i. 20, praev. et transire dicenda ; v. Glossary, praevaricari.
14. * From the secrets of his stock-in-trade,&apos; — P. ; artijiciu?n is technical

consilio, nunquam ullo artificio pervertet, nunquam ingenio me suo labe-
factare atque infirmare conabitur.&apos; 15. This repetition of the same word
at the beginning of the sentence was called eTram^opd, &apos;repetitio,&apos; in
rhetorical treatises, e.g. Cornif. iv. § 19. In Div. in Caec. Cic. similarly
deiides the stock rhetoric of the day, and its favourite exordia, &apos; lovem
ego opt. max.&apos; and &apos; vellem, si fieri potuisset, iudices.&apos;

in Cic), cp. Verr. ii. 4. 66, rex primo nihil metuere, nihil suspicari,
dies unus alter plures : non referri, and § 177, infra. In passages ex-
pressive of emotion, or picturing a passing series of events, the infin. is
often used, as expressing the simple fact of action without the ordinary
grammatical qualifications : as a man in alarm will cry &apos; Murder ! &apos; It is
a return to primitive speech. R. 1359, r. 539. 21. loco, &apos;common-

60. — Pag^e 23, 1. 5. si . . . condemnassent . . . consentire . . .
debuerunt ; an apparently irregular conditional sentence : in reality the
infin. with the modal verb debuerunt is equivalent to the plup. subj. con-
sensissent^ and is substituted for it. Another substitute is fut. partic^ple
with fui or eram. So in the pass. we have the plup. subj. replaced by
the gerundive with fui. These substituted forms differ from the ordinary
forms in expressing positive duty, intention, probability, etc. : where the
apodosis is dependent on some particle which takes the subj., the substituted
form is, as a rule, preferred, that the subj. may not have double duty to do.
Thus a sentence like Sest. § 62, quod ille si repudiasset, dubitatis quin ei
vis esset adlatal (for adferenda fuerit) is very exceptional. Madv. § 381.
Cp. Bradley&apos;s Arn. §46i.(R. 1564-1570, r. 652). 8. rescinderent, as also
absolverent, liberarent below (11. 12, 14) is a dubitative subj. (subj. inter-
Togative of a command) in past time. We have a kindred usage in § 90,
exspectasset (ubi v. n, ), and to take a case of an imperf., Liv. xlv. 37. 4,
non triumphum impediri debuit sed postero die . . . nomen deferret ; in

61. — 14. illa iudicia senatoria, &apos; the senatorial juries of the day.&apos;
Originally the juries for quaestiones perpetuae were taken from the sena-
torial order. In B.c. 122, the privilege of serving on juries was trans-
ferred by C. Gracchus to the party of his own creation, the equestrian
order : this was by the lex Sempronia iudiciaria. Successive attempts
were made by the Senate to recover the privilege : e.g. the lex Servilia
of B.c. 106 (§ 140). But it was only in b.c. 81 that they recovered it
absolutely, by the lex Cornelia of L. Sulla. The Senate in general
abused it in favour of corrupt provincial governors : the condemnation of
Verres came too late to retrieve the credit of that order : and in B.C. 70,
the lex Aurelia of Cotta vested the privilege in three orders jointly — the
Senate, Equites, and Tribuni aerarii (the last named being clerks or
treasury officials whose function it was to receive and disburse the tribu-

tum). (V. Ry. Kom. Ant. pp. 292, 293. ) We seem to have an allusion
to the three orders in ad Att. i. 16. 3, maculosi senatores, nudi equites,
tribuni non tam aerarii, ut appellantur, quam aerati, * Senators under a
stigma, destitute knights, paymasters who should rather be called pay-
takers &apos; (adopting Prof, TyrrelPs reading). invidia : the crisis which
preceded the passing of the lex Aurelia is described thus, Verr. i.
§ 2, nunc in ipso discrimine ordinis iudiciorumque vestrorum cum sint
parati qui contionibus et legibus hanc invidiam senatus inflammare conentur,
cet. The agitation of the tribune Quinctius after the * iudicium lunianum &apos;
(§§ 79&gt; 93) is mainly meant. 17. The following passage is an example
of an altercatio, which is opposed by the rhetoricians to perpetua oratio.
18. responderent, n. on rescijiderent, 1. 8. Perhaps, however, it is better
to treat the subj. as hypothetical. The imperf. is preferred to the
pluperf. , because the condition is one possible at the time of its making,
but falling in the province of things past. Cp. necaretur, § 45, 1. 10, with
note ; § 105, 1. 12, n. si qui : cp. n. on § 7, si qui deus. We

should expect si quis. 19. quod . . . voluisset, v, crit. n. It is
suboblique : that is, an oblique dependent clause cropping up in Or. Recta.
It is a reported reason ; the reason which they themselves entertained at
a previous time (that of the condemnation) and report now in terms
applicable to the reason of another persoji. &apos; We did it, on the ground
that he had desired,&apos; etc. Cp. R. 1744 (with ex. from Hor. Ep. i. 10.
49), r. 740. 2. [I should take the words nejnpe . . . voluisset as Cicero&apos;s,
not as the jurors&apos; answer. &apos; No doubt you will say you did it, because in
your opinion he had wished.&apos; Quod . . . voluerat would be a reason
now given for their former action : (as in § 55, quod dicebat :) possibly
quite a different reason from that on which they formerly acted. — H. J. R.]
21. consequebatur : mark the tense. *What was he likely to gain?&apos;
25. probabatur : cp. § loi, nummarius interpres pacis et concordiae non
probabatur ; where the verb, personally used, has the same sense : for
which v. Gloss. 27. inconstantiam, &apos; inconsistency &apos; — sc. sibi non

constabant res iudicatae : libidinem, &apos;caprice,&apos; is always used in a bad
sense- It signifies &apos; unregulated desire &apos; as opposed to voluntas, and even
cupido : so libet &apos; it is my fancy, &apos; but volo * I will, &apos; cupiOy &apos; I wish, &apos; placet,
&apos; it is my resolve. &apos; Quilibet, any one taken at random : quivis, any one

tinuous state (or in this case a tendency) existing in past time subject to the
condition expressed. This is the ordinary use of the imperf. subj. in the
apodosis (and, mutatis mutandis, the protasis) of conditional sentences,
where the reference is to past time : the use noted in §§ 45, 61, 105,
is exceptional. Cp. § 80, tum si dicerem, non audirer. It may
also denote an action supposed, contrary to the fact, to be already
occurring : the reference being to present time. So that &apos; hoc si diceres

fallacy. The dilemma propounded can be eluded by a third hypo-
thesis — that in fact both parties bribed. And this has the sanction of
a previous utterance of Cicero himself: Verr. i. §§ 38, 39, cognoscet
ex me populus Romanus, quid sit . . . quod inventus sit senator, qui cum
iudex esset, in eodem iudicio et ab reo pecuniam acciperet quam iudicibus

the argument with approval.)

XXIV. 65.— Page 25, l. n. Statium Albium Oppianicum. Nomen
and cognomen seem to be used almost indifferently in designating a person.
So Cluentius is constantly called Ilabitus. Cp. § 9 init. ; there the words
of the indictment against Cluentius seem to be quoted (cp. n. on quo) :
here Cicero frames his own indictment as a retort, and it seems as
though &apos; Statius Albius &apos; were a more formal designation than &apos; Oppianicus. &apos;
15. negate, inquam, meo loco, &apos; deny it, I say, though you should
interrupt me in order to make the denial.&apos; Cp. crit. n. : meo loco is the
Greek kv rC^ e^ty vbari (an expression derived from the use in court of the
clepsydra or water-clock). Whichever reading we adopt, it is implied
that the counsel for the defence might not be interrupted in the course of
his speech by the prosecution, except upon his own challenge. 16. an
introduces the second alternative in a disjunctive question (cp. n. on
§ 99, 1. 8). Here the first alternative is not (as sometimes happens)
suppressed : rather, it is contained in quid tacetis ? * Why are you
silent ? am I right in saying si/ent ? or is it the case that you must speak
in despite of yourselves?&apos; An almost = nonne: cp. a similar sentence
in § 181, where however an = num. 17. repetistis, sc. a Staieno,
from whom the bribe-money was recovered by legal action, § jS.

words that the mannerism attracted the ridicule of his contemporaries,
and the imitation of the young rhetoricians of a later day. Cp. Tac, Dial.
de Orator. xxiii., illud tertio quoque sensu {&apos;in every third sentence &apos;) in
omnibus orationibus pro sententia positum &apos; esse videatur &apos; ; Quint. x. 2.
i8, noveram quosdam qui se pulchre expressisse genus illud caelestis
huius in dicendo viri sibi viderentur, si in clausula posuissent *esse

Potts, L. Pr. Comp. pp. 97-99.) 32. cupidiore, *more partial&apos; :

cp. the phrase omnia alicui (alicuius causa) cupere. So de Or. ii. § 129,
utimur facetiis in testem stuhum cupidum levem ; Caec. § 8, cupidior
quam sapientem iudicem esse aequum est. But we might take it in the
sense which it certainly bears in § 152 (sine cupiditate = integritate),
&apos; desirous ofgain,&apos; &apos;grasping,&apos; &apos;mercenary.&apos;

7. capiti ac fortunis, a standing formula for the complex of a man&apos;s
social and political rights. If he were capite deminutus, he had suffered
the curtailment of these. There were three degrees of capitis deminutio :
maxifna, the loss of ^txs,oxi2l freedo?n, which involved the loss of citizen-
ship ; minor, the loss of fuU Roman citizenship, whether by assumption
of the citizenship of another state, or by voluntary exile followed by aquae
et ignis interdictio (which made the exercise of Roman rights at Rome
impossible) ; minima, by adoption into another family. (V. Ry. Ro7n.
Ant. pp. 84, 85.) Thus a man&apos;s caput comprised three things, — libertas,
civitas, familia.

XXV. — 8. lam : introducing a general truth, as in § 46 (ubi v.
crit. n.), § 57, 9. monitae, &apos;reminded&apos;: the original sense of the

word, which is a causative from sj^nan, to think (in mens, memini ; MoGo-at,
the goddesses who bring the past to the poet&apos;s mind) : its subst. is
monumentum, as in Verg. A. v. 538, monumentum et pignus amoris.

68. — II. causam bonorum Safini Atellae, a cause cetebre of the day,
known as the iudiciufn Safinianum (§ 99) to Cicero&apos;s hearers. We can
only conjecture what it was. Safinius was a pupillus or ward, whose
property had (apparently) been allowed by his guardians to come to a
forced sale, owing to encumbrances upon it. He seems to have sued his

guardians and lost his case, Staienus having embezzled 600,000 sesterces
placed in his hands for the purpose of bribing the jury (cp. § 69, illo
absoluto . . . neminem, which refers to the experience of Staienus in the
iud. lunianum). Staienus then kept the money to himself [suppressit ) ;
neither Safinius nor the purchasers of the estate (bonorum emptores) got
any of it. (So Mr. Roby understands the passage. The close analogy of
the conduct of Staienus in the iud. lunianum makes it probable that the
case went against Safinius.) Atell^ae might be taken as locative, &apos; at A.&apos;
causam . . . recepisset : in §§ 49, 136 we have the commoner phrase
causam suscipere. As far as we can distinguish the words, recipere
implies that something is undertaken as of ohligation ; suscipere is a
voluntary undertaking. Or again, recipere is to undertake an ofifice with
a sense of responsibility, which suscipere does not necessarily imply : so
here. Cp. Div. in Caec. § 26, ego in hoc iudicio mihi Siculorum causam
receptam, populi Romani susceptam esse arbitror (cp. reff. in Heitland
and Cowie&apos;s n.). Madv. {defin. i. § 68) says, recipiuntur tantum ea quae
demandata et tradita sic suscipi?mis ut promittamus ahquid et rationem
debeamus. 14. nec bonorum emptoribus : The b. ejnptores (or efuptor)
were persons (or a person) who bought, not certain articles, but the whole
estate of the deceased or the bankrupt, and had of course afterwards to
collect the credits and defray the debts. The money given by Safinius
to Staienus presumably was part of the estate sold, and therefore
belonged either to Safinius, if the sale was upset, or to the purchasers,
if it was upheld — On bon. emptor v. Gai. iii. § 78 : Cic. Quinct. § 60. —
[H. J. R.] 15. non modo (non) . . . sed ne . . . qiuidem : cp. § 9,
1. 4 n. 17. suppressiones iudiciales. The Lat. adj. is often

used to correspond with the gen. of ihe subst. in its various usages,
especially when the subst. in question is generic in sense ; in other
words, when if sing. it takes the indefinite article in English, if plur.
takes no article. Here itidiciales answers to iudiciortim, a gen. equivalent
to a prepositional phrase, &apos; in trials.&apos; For other instances of the adj.
answering to a gen. cp. § 61, iudicia sena.toria. = senatorum, subjective gen. ;
§ 77, invidia sena.tona. = senatus, objective gen. ; § 123, dictatorium stilum
= dictatoris, possessive gen. The use of the adj. for the plural gen. has
not been sufficiently noticed : e.g. Sest. §115, theatrales gladiatoriique
consessus compared with ib. § 106, ludorum gladiatorumque consessu,
infr. § 123, subscriptio censoria = censorum. 18. iugulatum, a strange
metaphor to us : lit. &apos; with the throat cut &apos; : we might say colloquially,
*knocked on the head by the two previous verdicts.&apos; So Mil. § 31,
optabilius Miloni fuit dare iugulum P. Clodio . . . quam iugulari a vobis.
The defendant may be said to be laqueis legum co?istrictus : when con-
demned, to be iugulatus. Cp. also § 84, cum faucibus premeretur.
20. saluti desperare : so Mur. § 45, quoniam sibi hic ipse desperat. The
common construction is the accus. : Mur. § 43, ut honorem desperasse
videatur ; sometimes the verb takes de with abl. , especially in Caesar.

After the battle of Cannae, the consul Varro was publicly thanked quod
de re publica non desperasset, Liv. xxii. 6l. There is no uniform distinc-
tion in meaning between the accus. and dat. constructions : in the
former, the meaning is &apos; to give up in despair,&apos; or &apos; give up hope of,&apos; and
this is preferred in phrases such as rem publicam, rei pubhcae statum,
desperare : ad Att. vii. 23. 2, causa publica desperata ; ib. § 3, desperata

ad Att. ix. 12. 2, it is used with some temper of Dionysius, a friend who
had been false to Cicero, &apos; a quo impurissime haec nostra fortuna
despecta est.&apos; Modern taste is ofifended by the indiscriminating use of
such epithets in the ancient orators. (Sylvius weakens it here by explain-
ing it * avarissimus.^) 31. Tr. in such cases by Or. Recta, according

Yexg. rapio 2ind proripio (quo proripis, A. v. ^/^i^^paro (cui fata parent, A.

(Ussing), quo incumbat eo impellere. &apos; Let us give him a push down
the incHne.&apos; perditum prosternamus, &apos;let us dash him down
to destruction,&apos; Peterson. This gives a good sense, but is doubtful in
point of syntax. Such prolepsis of the adj. or part. is only poetic or
used with factitive verbs : the use of praecipitem with dare, mittere, and
other verbs is almost unique. Madv. § 481, 2.^ We get a perfectly good
sense without resorting to this : &apos; Let us prostrate him when over-
thrown,&apos; i.e. &apos; let us give him the finishing blow.&apos; The parallelism of the
two clauses is in favour of this. The incisive vigour of the conchision is
helped by the alHteration.

Hence the perversity of Staienus in beginning with Bulbus — &apos; Then again
this master in cookery [conditor totius negotii, another pun, as conditor
may come from condire or condere) adds a dash of Gutta-seasoning to
his vegetable friend Bulbus : so that (§ 72, 11. 29, 30) those who got a tidbit
of promise from the latter voted him a very palatable fellow.&apos; Peterson
doubts the pun in conditor &apos;, but &apos;smtXy condisset (§ 72, 1. 10) leaves it
beyond a doubt. Ry. says that gutta signifies a narrow-necked flask from
which the fluid does not flow, but drop. I know of no authority for this
statement as to the use oi gutta : guttus {or gutus) is thus used, e.g. Hor.
Serm. i. 6. 118, cum patera gutus. Prof. Nettleship suggests {Journal

ascendisset ad honores, nisi in facinore manifesto deprehensus poenas
legibus et iudicio dedisset. There were several familiae in the gens
Aelia with cognomina Lamia, Ligus, Paetus, etc. : Staienus had taken the
cognomen Paetus, therein showing more sagacity than the Sextus Aelius
who is ridiculed in Sest. § 69 for having assumed the ancient cognomen of
Ligus — &apos; cognomen sibi ex Aeliorum imaginibus arripuit, quo magis
nationis eius esse quam generis videretur.&apos; The trihe of the Ligures was
notorious for its treachery : Verg. A. xi. 715, vane Ligus, where Serv.

On either side of the atrium in a Roman noble&apos;s house were placed the
imagines or wax masks (expressi- cera voltus, Plin. N. H. xxxv. 6) of his
ancestors, each in its Httle shrine {armaritwi, vaChov, Polyb. ) ; attached to
each was a tituhis declaring the honours achieved in Hfe by the man
portrayed, and from one to another painted lines v/ere drawn to express
the pedigree which connected them. Only famihes in which curule office
had been attained enjoyed the right to display these (the ius imagimim ;
cp. Glossary on nobilitas). When a funeral took place in the family, the
masks were taken out of their shrines and worn by persons who walked
before the bier in the garb and with the insignia (including the lictors)
which had belonged to the deceased ancestor : so that the Roman
noble was Hterally preceded to the grave by his ancestry. On this

17 were secured to make &apos;assurance double sure.&apos; Otherwise the words

be safe.&apos; But Zumpt holds that an equality of votes was sufficient for

So cumti/ahis = &apos; topped with a cumulus,&apos; i.e. &apos;perfect&apos;; just as coron-

Att. xvi. II. 2 (no. 122 in Watson), de laudibus Dolabellae deruam
cumulum ; Marcell. § 34, ad tua in me . . . merita . . . maximus hoc tuo

haps awaits a solution), quam mihi cum dederis [v. 1. dederit] cumulatam
[v. 1. — ta] morte remittam, this meaning is probable : &apos; which when you
have granted me, I will repay it in full measure at my death,&apos; rather
than &apos; with interest &apos; (as generally taken) : cumtilatus implies &apos; good
measure pressed down and running over.&apos; 28. Staienus ipse non

and viatores, the special function of the latter being to carry messages
and summons. The tribunes of the plebs had only viatores. By them
they might exercise their ius prehensionis (Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 143). Cp.
Mommsen, R. Staatsr. i. ^, p. 262. — The proceedings of L. Quinctius
illustrate the position of the tribunes at this time. He has no right of
&apos; intercession &apos; as against a criminal court {quaestio) or its president
[quaesitor). So Vatin. § 33, quaero fecerisne quod in hac re pubHca . . .
in omni memoria est omnino inauditum ? appellarisne tribunos plebis ne
causam diceres ? (this was after being cited by the praetor.) Quinctius
could delay this trial without resorting to intercession. The law under
which the quaestio was constituted generally forbade intercessio expressly.
Turning to 1. 2, p. 29, pro potestate dimitti iussit, we have here an in-
stance of tribunician ^- prohibition,&apos; — a less formidable weapon than inter-
cession, for it did not annul the act in question, but merely threatened
the agent with coercitio (in its various forms, arrest, fining, execution,
etc) in case of disobedience. While Sulla limited still more the use
of * intercession &apos; by the tribunes, he left them the right of &apos; prohibi-
tion &apos; in full. Mommsen, R. Staatsr. i. p. 262 ; ii. pp. 286, 297.

invites attention. So in English : e.g. Shakespeare, 2 Hen. IV. iii. 2.

desuetude (v. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 299, ampliatio). [&apos; Men of the old

with sapientes as an epithet of homines). So Sest. § 64, iniuriis in socios ;

to pubhc character, hotno to private character : so Sex. Rosc. § 51, cuni

sortito, composito, explorato (&apos; ithavingbeenreconnoitred^^^^j^/zwa/i?, necopi-
nato and improviso{^\\. being unexpected &apos;), merito (R. 1253). They are really
itnpersonal ablatives absolute. Sometimes we have the abl. of the part.
with a subject-clause dependent, as Cic. de Fin. ii. § 85, perfecto et con-
cluso neque virtutibus neque amicitiis usquam locum esse ; Liv. xxxiii. 41,
cognito vivere Ptolemaeum. But this is not the older usage : for the
impersonal abs. part. without a subject-clause is commoner than it, until
we come to Livy and Tacitus. 17. in forum prolata : so Top. § 75

Commentators deride this argument, and say that Cluentius would never
have booked his bribes as such. But, to say nothing of the difificulty of
accounting for a disbursement of 640,000 sesterces under the head of
ordinary expenditure, the jurors would no more be startled into incredulity
by an appeal to the ledger of a paterfamilias in evidence, than the
assessors of income-tax are when a merchant submits his books in evi-
dence of the amount of his income. &apos; A creditor&apos;s account-books were

actions expressed in the principal and the dependent verbs is a mere rela-
tion of time ; by the subj. if it is a connection of purpose, intention, con-
sequence, and the like : and the principal tenses, viz., pres., perf., fut.,
are those commonly employed in the former case (the imperf. also 77iay
denote a past state). Thus it is with cum^ &apos; when&apos; : it commonly takes
pres., perf., or fut. indic, imperf. and pluperf. subj. But (a) tum may
precede cum^ marking that it gives a mere date or note of time : Phil. vi.
§ II, oderat tum cum ille tabulis novis adversabatur. {b) There is the con-
struction of &apos; r«;// inversum &apos; : cum = et tmn, and takes indic. R. 1733,
^&apos; 735* (0 Eut a large residuum of instances remains unexplained.
From the classical period onwards there was a growing tendency to prefer
the subj. in past time. But in this, as in some other matters, Cicero
retains much of the practice of the early school of writers. Two German
writers, Hoffmann and Liibbert (the latter in a treatise of 255 pages), have
recently examined the whole subject, and compiled statistics. Caesaruses
the Subj. 383 times, the Indic. 35 times ; Livy the Subj. 2864 times, the
Indic. 272 times ; Tacitus the Subj. 278 times, the Indic. 94 times;^
whereas Plautus has the Subj. 9 times, the Indic. 229 times. As
to the Imperf. Indic. with cum, Cic. has it 241 times (including the ad
Herenn. ), Caesar 4 times, Tac. once. It is frequent in Cicero&apos;s letters as a
mere note of time : ad Fa77i. iii, 13. 2, cum haec scribebam . . . sperabam.
Also when the subject of the two verbs is the same : especially when the
cut7i clause appends an explanation, as Verr. ii. i. 121, ridiculi vide-
bantur esse, cum Sacerdotem exsecrabantur. But the present passage
shows how capricious the usage is. Hoffmann&apos;s distinction between the
absolute time of the indic. and the relative time of the subj. (for which
V. the account in Lewis and Short, art. 2. cum, C, which is as clear as
may be) does not help us much here. The accident of identity of subjects
to i7iitteba7it and requirebant may have led to the use of the indic. in the
latter of the two r«w-clauses (v. R. 1729, r. 731). Draeger&apos;s parallels
are not exact : the comparison of Tusc. ii. § 35, cum varices secabantur
C. Mario, laborabat, with ib. § 53, C. Marius cum secaretur . . . vetuit se
adligari, is misleading : the former passage gives a 77iere definition of
labor, sc. dolor ; not so the latter. A speaker is happily innocent of the
subtleties of scientific grammar, as he chooses his words. His ear, and
the unconscious memory of his previous usage, determine his choice to a
large extent. Style is something between a growth and a fabric ; it is
neither of these exchisively. It is not even exempt from physical re-
strictions. The &apos;personal factor&apos; may at any time enter and upset the
calculations of science. [The chapter in Roby on the &apos;Subj. (F),
Attendant Circumstances &apos; will be found to be the most practical authority
on this question.] 21. On the retirement of the jury to consider their
verdict, cp. n. on § 55. 22. Oppianicus queretoatur : the force of the

elaborate chiasmus, § 183. There is a similar antithesis in Caiil. ii.

hominem ! hancine impudentiam, iudices ! hanc audaciam ! civitatibus pro
numero militum pecuniarum summas discribere ! No ellipse of a pre-
dicate need be supposed. The inf. conveys the abstract idea of action

expression of this passage, cp. supra, § 8. 19. ista multa iudicia : the
ordinary idiom would require ista tot iud. , or ista ta??t multa iud. , or ista
plurima iud. That is to say, the demonstr. pron. in combination
with a subst., if it takes a descriptive adj. between the two, takes it
sharpened by tam or in the superl. degree, or if the adj. be multus or
magmis, changes it to tot tantus (or it may be talis). So § 123, illa

§ 185, illam nefariam mulierem. We may say of all these adjectives
(except the first, and perhaps Planc. § 73), that they are superlative in
idea, or (in iwo instances) participial. Where the adj. is an integral part
of the noun idea, this rule does not apply. Nor does it concern expres-
sions such as Verr. i. § 36, hoc scelere nefario, § 30, hanc mortem
repentinam, where the adj. stands outside. Here it is natural to take up

quaestionis, § 55, qtiaesitor, v. n. and ref. [Momms., R. Staatsr. ii.
572, pronounces this one of the most difficult to understand of Roman
institutions.] This judgeship seems to have had its fixed place in the scale
of official promotions : from § 79 (homo aedilicius, iam praetor opin-
ione hominum constitutus) we should infer that it came between the
aedileship and praetorship. Yet it was not a magistracy conferred by
vote of the comitia : it is indeed distinguished from such magistracies.
The iud. quaestionis must have been nominated by the praetor, who
properly presided over his quaestio : or the office followed upon the aedile-
ship in course, as a proconsulship did upon a consulship. It was of a
year&apos;s duration. It is especially associated with the quaestio de sicariis et
veneficis, one of the busiest courts during this period of social anarchy.
Consult Ry. Introd. to this speech, § 9 ; Momms. R. Staatsr. ii.- 574,
575. &apos; So far was the tribune from making any allowance for the

necessities of the action that he would not respect those of the law

Sylvius) allowed the defendant ten days&apos; grace for getting it up. Legi
(not ^ law^ in the abstract, which would be legibus, but) the particular
law which defined the rights of a iudex quaestionis. We need not (with
P. ) suppose a zeugma. By a forcible figure Cic. says &apos; not only did he
show Junius no mercy, give him no tether : he showed the law
itself 710 mercy.&apos;&apos; It was not merely rigid interpretation of the
law : it was its positive violation. Lemaire denies that there was any lex
in the above sense : it was, he thinks, mere * fnos &apos; or habitual usage which
ensured immunity from citation to the iud. quaestionis. He denies that the
office was a magistracy in any sense of the word, and considers legi mere
rhetoric. For non modo (non) cp. n. on § 9. 32. Quo tempore . . .

the argument that Junius would have had to be summoned before his own
tribunal may seem inconsistent with the fact that there may have been as
many as three iudices quaestionis presiding over the quaestio inter sicarios
(as in this year Q. Voconius Naso, M. Plaetorius, C. Flaminius ; v. § 147).
Mommsen&apos;s hypothesis, that different iudices administered dififerent sec-

&apos; ought to have waited.&apos; Quinctius ought to have waited a few days :
then he might have prosecuted under the lex Corneha. Cp. note on
rescinderent, § 60. Exspectasset = exspectare debuit. There are two ex-
planations of this use of the imperf. and pluperf. subj. (not unfrequent
in Cic. and in the comic poets), which expresses &apos; non id quod fieret fac-
tumve esset sed quod fieri debuerit.&apos; (a) It is the apodosis to a suppressed
protasis — &apos; si quod debuit fecisset.&apos; So Mr. Reid takes it, Sull. § 25, si
ceteris patriciis me et vos peregrinos videri oporteret, a Torquato tamen
hoc vitium sileretur, supplying si caperet. {b) The force of obligation is
conveyed in the mood itself. It is indeed too express to be explained as a
nuance or variety of the potential subj. It stands in its own right, with
\S\Q.jussive subj. and the dubitative or deliberative subj. (subj. interroga-
tive of a command) — part of the original inheritance of Indo-European
syntax, we may believe.^ (Though the Lat. subj. is syncretistic, i.e.

partly subj. in form, partly opt., analogy has unified the syntactic usage of
its tenses. ) This Ciceronian usage strikes us indeed as a survival :
Madv. de Fin. ii. 36 gives no post-Ciceronian prose ex. but Liv. xlv.
37. 4. It is noticeable also that it is negatived by ne^ not non : Att. ii.
I. 3, aut ne poposcisses. Hence Pl. Trin. 133, non ego illi argentum
redderem ? Non redderes is anomalous. To this Mr. Reid can only say
that in early Latin ne is equivalent to noti. The phip. differs from the
imperf. as debuit does from debebat. The following exx. illustrate this
use : Verg. A. iv. 678, sprevisti moriens? eadem me ad fata vocasses ;
ib. viii. 643, at tu dictis, Albane, maneres ; Sest. § 45, forsitan nonnemo
vir fortis . . . dixerit restitisses, repugnasses, mortem pugnans oppetisses.
Cp. Liv. l.c. sub § 60, 1. 7. This subj. is treated in much the same
way by R. 1604, r. 670 ; Madv. § 351, obs. 4 ; Zumpt, § 529 n.; Kvihner
ii. I. p. 141. Madv. de Fin. ii. § 36 is a repertory of exx. V. also Mayor,
Cic. N. D. iii. § 76. It is frequently parallel (as here) to debuit, oportuit,
debebat, oportebat, with inf., and is thus defined by the context as not
being simply potential. If it were, it is not clear why it never expresses
possibility as well as obligation. 12. potestate : cp. § 79, 1. i.

91. — 13. Multam petivit : doubtless this was one of those cases in

178 n. 5. (But this was not a prosecution under the lex Cornelia de
sicariis, as it is there implied. ) 14. Like the ordinary magistrate, the
iudex quaestionis had to take an official oath within five days after his
assumption of office ; though, unlike the juror&apos;s oath, it was a mere
formaHty, as we gather from this passage and Verr. i. § 32, hoc animo
sum ut eo iudice quam praetore hanc rem transigi maUm et iurato suam
quam iniurato aliorum tabellas committere ; in the latter of which the
praetor is called iniuratus^ as far as this same oath is concerned. Cp.
also n. on § 121, iurati. [Ry., however, may be right in supposing
the oath of the iud. qiiaestionis (as distinguished from the praetor) to
have been more than the ordinary official oath — an oath that he would
administer justice according to the special law under which the trial was
held. The sing. legem makes for this view. Cp. Sest. § 37, of Metellus
refusing to swear to the lex Appuleia, cum unus in legem per vim latam

been so, probably Quinctius would not have hesitated to impeach Junius
on the direct charge of &apos; judicial murder &apos; {/lac lege) before the comitia (not
before the appropriate quaestio) : theobjection &apos; at ipse ea lege quaerebat &apos;

notorious case of corrupt procedure, in which the praetor Verres was in
league with the iud. quaestionis Junius, and afterwards falsified his register,
fearing to share the fate of the latter — multos ex te viros primarios audisse

worthless.

quially much used. The alternative form of denial is that of Ter. Ad. iv. 2.
30, sed estne frater intus ? No7i est. So too of words for * yes, &apos; such as ita

to the wealth of the classical languages in particles, partly perhaps to the

to have been a flight of steps leading up to the elevated platform of the

the whole structure was the work of M. Aurelius Cotta, consul with L.

peculatu, § 147. II. locus . . . non est constitutus, i.e. the ludices
refused to place the cause upon the roll for trial (Ry.). It is evident from
this passage and §§ 56, 59 that the iudices of any quaestio could take the
cases which were to be tried in what order they pleased, and could also
(as an English Grand Jury) refuse to entertain a charge. Also from the
Div. in Caec. we know that such a jury (unsworn) had sometimes to de-
cide between two claimants for the office of accuser. (V. Ry.&apos;s note.)
L. Cornelius Sulla Faustus was the son of the dictator, to whom his
colossal fortune (supposed to have been acquired by the appropriation of
public moneys) had passed. Among the personal attacks which attended
the democratic reaction from the Sullan constitution (dating from B.C 70
— the restoration of the tribunician power in its entirety), those made on
Faustus Sulla were the most persistent. V. Momms. iv. 2, pp. 160, 161 ;
Ry. on this passage. So leg. agr. i. § 12 (spoken B.c. 63) of the golden
dreams of the agrarian commissioners : &apos; maximam pecuniam se a Fausto
ablaturos arbitrantur : quam causam suscipere iurati iudices noluerunt,.
hanc isti decemviri suscepere.&apos; Such an action had been unsuccessfully
brought against Sulla in the year of this speech. Cicero was adverse to it :
fr. oi pro Cornel. i. quam ego causam [de Sullae bonis] . . . praetor in
contione defendi, cum id dicerem quod eidem iudices postea statuerunt,
iudicium aequiore tempore fieri oportere. ii. de pecuniis residuis = ut
pecuniae publicae, quae residuae apud quemque essent, exigerentur (Ascon.
on Cornel. i. l.c). Such charges were originally preferred under the
statute de peculatu. But in the last century of the Republic a distinction
was drawn between misappropriation of public money (pecuniam avertere,
in rem suam vertere), and neglect to disburse for the public service all the
money assigned. Pecuniae residuae is that which is over (residet) and is
not expended for the state : lege Julia de residuis tenetur qui pecuniam
publicam delegatam in usum aliquem retinuit neque in eum consumpsit
(Digest, xlviii. 13. 1. 2). The action was in our case to recover arrears
of public money left in the hands of Sulla. V. Ry. Kom. Ant. p. 308.

r. 527 : de with abl. is sometimes used, cp. § 116, reo damnato de pecu-
niis repetundis : also the abl. crimine, actione (and sometimes scelere),
R. 1229. The. penalty is expressed by the locative, as damnatus octupli :
the genitives capitis, pecuniae, Capitalis poenae : the abl., capite damnatus.
We have poetical applications of these constructions in voti reus, Verg.
A. v. 237 ; damnatusque longi | Sisyphus Aeolides laboris, Hor. C. ii.
14. 19. The crime, the charge, and the penalty are liable to be con-
used with one another : in voti reus it is hard to say which idea the gen.
denotes ; probably the last. Morti dafnnatus is probably an instance of
the abl. construction. R. 1200, 1199, 1325 ; r. 494, 495. 16. hociud.,

III. Third iudicium : Popilius and Gutta tried for Ambitus.

XXXVI. 98.— 31. P. Popili : of course a different person from the
Popilius of § 95. 32. V. crit. n. The argument is far from clear :

possibly Cic. intended it so. Prof. Nettleship&apos;s suggestion {qtda acc. for
qui acc, I. 32) would simplify matters : the accumulation of relatives here
is unpleasant. Also it seems to gain support from Quint. v. 10. 108 ; Cicero
pro Cluentio P. Popilium et Ti. Guttam dicit non iudicii corrupti sed ambi-
tus esse damnatos : qzcid signi ? quod accusatores eorum qui erant ipsi
ambitus damnati, e lege sint post hanc victoriam restituti : &apos; They were
condemned not for tampering with itidices, but for ambitus, because
their accusers, who had themselves been condemned for ambitus, were
subsequently restored to their civil rights.&apos; This is further explained
by what Modestinus (in Digest 48. 14. 2) says on the Lex Julia de ambitu
— &apos; qua lege damnatus, si alium convicerit, in integrum restituitur : non
tamen pecuniam recipit. &apos; No such &apos; praemia legis &apos; were offered under the
lex de sicariis or the lex repetundarum (under which alone the offence of
taking a bribe as a juror could be indicted). Therefore they were indicted
for ambittis, an entirely distinct offence : cp. n. on § I14. (But Cic.
chooses to ignore the fact that at Rome, while a man might be prose-
cuted under one lex, offences contravening another lex might bring about
his condemnation.) V. Prof. Nettleship, Essays in Lat. Lit. pp. 79,
80, 81. 33. ambitus, &apos; corrupt practices &apos; at an election : an offence

dealt with by a series of laws, the most stringent being the lex Cal-
purnia of B.C. 67, which doomed the convicted briber to perpetual
exclusion from the senate and all public office. Thus when Cic. speaks
here of a restituiio in integriwi he refers to the state of the law be-
fore B.c. 67. (Mr. Reid, introd. io pro SicU. pp. 10, 11 ; Ry. Rotn.
Ant. 308, 309.) As to the word ambitus, cp. n. on ambitio, % 76.
Page 38, 1. i. in integrum : v. Gloss. integer. 3. reprehendissent,
&apos; had brought others to a reckoning upon the same charge to which they
themselves had succumbed.&apos; For offendissent v. Glossary. Reprehendis-
sent, &apos; had publicly shown their disapproval,&apos; Prof. Nettleship explains
{Essays, p. 81) ; comparing Font. § 3, atqui homines si qui [tenentur] hoc
genere quaestionis, accusatos et reprehensos videmus primum testibus.
The metaphor is similar to that in offendo : &apos; to puUup,&apos; &apos; to hold a person
back as he is stumbling or making off &apos; : Acad. ii. § 139, revocat virtusvel
potius reprehendit manu.

viction of Staienus?&apos; Non dico . . ., a common form of occupatio —
i.e. the implied assertion of a thing by the expression of an intention of
passing it over. Cornif. iv. § 37 calls it occultatio : &apos; quom dicimus nos
praeterire aut non scire aut noUe dicere id, quod nunc maxime dicimus.&apos;
(Mark Antony&apos;s funeral-speech in Shakesp. yul. Caesar affords repeated
instances of this device, employed to rouse the dormant passions of
the citizens :

&apos; O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong . . .
I will not do them wrong. . . .
But here &apos;s a parchment with the seal of Caesar . . .
Which, pardon me, I do notmean to read.&apos;

8. nescio an, &apos; I almost think,&apos; in Cic. a modest affirmation. An in-
troduces the second member of a disjunctive interrogation. Pl. Rud.
i. 2. 16 gives the original form of such questions : utrum tu masne
an femina es ? &apos; Which of the tzuo [is true] ? are you male or female ? &apos;
Then for the first member utrum alone became the interrogative particle,
answering to an, or -ne alone was used, or no particle at all : or the first
member is wanting altogether. In this last case the expressed member
(with an) has a tone of irony or wonder which a simple question with -ne
would lack, Here (a) cp. § 136, an potuit rem delatam eiusmodi
repudiare? (with n.) &apos; Do you mean to say that it could have refused ?&apos;
As a general rule, a negative answer to the question (as asked) is expected :
an = 7ium. {b) But sometimes not : v. § 65, quid tacetis? an negare non
potestis quod repetistis ? de Off. i. § 48, quidnam officio provocati facere
debemus ? an imitari agros fertiles, qui multo plus efferunt quam accepe-
runt ? This=num quid aliud f. debemus an imitari . . . ? Thus an
z\mo%\. = no7ine. The single a;z-clause, depeitdent, answers in character
to {b). When governed by nescio, dzibito, and the like, the expressed
alternative with aw is that to which the speaker inclines : ad Att. ii. 6. i,
qui etiam dubitem an hic Antii considam, &apos; why, I actually consider
whether it would not be well to settle down here at A.&apos; Cp. R. 2254-
2256, r. 887, 888; notes on § 65, § 136. 11. Mam. Aemilio :

V. crit. n. praefecti (socium) : these were Roman ofificers nominated ■

the Roman contingent, who in the case supposed would be twelve in
number. 15. nomine iud. Safin.; cp. § 68 siipr. for the circumstances.

classical prose Latin) when it has an attribute, even though only a pro-
nominal one, as here. ( We find the same qualification in the case of the
abl. of quality, of manner, and of time when.) So Sall.y^^^. 79, pleraque
Africa ; Verr. ii. 2. 44, ceteras dicas omnis illo foro M. Postumius
quaestor sortitus est. WithoMt an attribute it is only used in the case of
certain proper names, and of a few stereotyped local expressions, such as
terra, niari, via, loco : v. R. I170 S(/^., r. 486 sq(/. 19. P. Cominius :

thus noticed, Brut. § 271, P. Com. Spoletinum, quo accusante defendi

cording to Asconius (argumentum in or. pro C. Cornelio) the two Cominii
prosecuted Cornelius for maiestas, &apos; detulit nomen Publius, subcripsit

reading. 23. conciliandae gratiae, § 84 ad init.

sentence. The arrangement of the firsttwomembers (^;c^^. . . . fallaciae,

arrangement of words in positions exactly corresponding ; here in the
sequence subst., attribute, verb). Cp. n. on § 83, 1. 26. Exagita-

use of agiio, &apos; to hunt down,&apos; § 82. (In §§ 4, 88, however, it has the mean-

102. — Quam ob rem . . . conflrmet ; Cicero&apos;s argument again takes
refuge in sonorous obscurity. To apprehend it we must notice that cum
ita . . . Oppianicus is a parenthesis, and relates to what follows, not what

154 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [xxxvii. 103

precedesit. The protasis of the sentence (si . . . ablataest) consists of two
arguments, both dependent on si, the first giving the prior condition, the
second the later condition which clenches it — the first gives indirect, the
second direct, proof of the guilt of Opp. The sentence may thus be sum-
marised : (i.) The verdict against Staienus (indirectly) asserted Opp.&apos;s
guilt (and you must remember that we agreed that ei^/ier ChxenVms crOpp.
must have bribed) ; (ii.) and while I defy you to prove anything against
Cluentius, there is direct evidenceofa damning kind against Opp. — his
recovery of bribe-money from Staienus by law. Therefore Staienus&apos; con-
demnation, far from telling against Cluent., is strong evidence _/i7r him.
The parts of the protasis are related to the conclusion in the same way as
they would be if si were repeated before cum : cp. n, on § 6, 1. 30. The
sentences Cluenti . . . reperietur^ Oppianici . . . ablata est are in an ad-
versative asyndeton (the unexpressed connection is &apos; but,^ not * and^). In
Greek we should have ixiv and 5^. On the worth of the latter of the two
arguments cp. n. on § 64. Page 39, 1. 5- post iudicium, sc.

appellet . . . confiteatur necesse est : the form of the conditional
sentence is irregular : in the apodosis the assertion of necessity is made
independently of the condition («. est instead of n. sit). The form for
an imaginary condition is preferred because the condition si appellet has in
effect just been negatived — potius quavi iud. appellandu7n putei7i. Cp.
div. i7t Caec. § 21, cur nolint, etiam si taceant, satis dicunt : verum non

not for the fact stated [condemnarat) but for the fact of its statement as
something noteworthy {etim condemnavisse velim atii?nadvertatis). It is
an instance of the principle of substitution noticed upon § 85, 1. 17. For
this acquired meaning oi praesertim cum or cmyi praesertim cp. Mayor&apos;s n.

abl. 24. non suae decuriae munere, &apos; usurping a duty which did not
belong to his decury.&apos; The exact significance of this last expression dur-
ingthe period here in question, B.c. 81 to B.c. 70 (from the lex Corneha
iudiciaria to the lex Aureha), is not very certain. The alhum iudicum or
list of jurymen to serve throughout the year in the difFerent courts would
seem from b.c. 70 onwards to have been made out by the praetor tirhanus
from the three orders (senators, knights, tribuni aerarii), each of the three
forming a decuria. (Augustus added a fourth, the dticenarii ; cp. n. on
§ 121, 1. 12.) But during this preceding period, senators alone being com-
petent to serve, the roll of the senate was itself a list of jurymen, magis-
trates in ofifice being excepted. Then comes the question, What were the
decuriael (i.) Some explain them as subdivisions of the senate, con-
sulares, praetorii, and the other ex-magistrates (Zumpt, deleg. iudic. repet.
P- 37)&gt; referring to Verr. ii. 2. 79, hic alteram decuriam senatoriam iudex
obtinebit ? But this is slender evidence. Madvig however accepts the
inference from the passage {Verfass. ii. p. 225). (ii.) It is more pro-
bable that each decuty was at this time a division of jurors which
served in one particular court or quaestio : Verr. i. § 16, in sortitione
istius spem fortuna populi Romani et in reiciendis iudicibus mea dili-
gentia istorum impudentiam vicerat : &apos; in the balloting for the decury
which was to try Verres&apos; case Rome&apos;s fortune had triumphed over his
hopes,&apos; etc. The Schol. Gronov. explains thispassage thus : perdecurias
erat senatus divisus ; unam decuriam praetor dabat, ut ex hac iudices
reicerentur. Ergo fortuna populi Romani fecit, ut ea decuria daretur a
praetore, quae paucos habuit malos ; meaautem diligentiafecit ut mehores
eligerentur. — Fidiculanius Falcula had broken the law in two points : {a)
though not belonging to the decury which was to serve in the quaestio de
veneficis, he had allowed himself to be placed upon a jury in that court ;
{b) he had served, his name not being entered in the praetor&apos;s register. V.

104. — 32. With what Cic. says here of the second trial of Fidiculanius
Falcula for having taken a bribe from Quent. we must contrast what he
said in the pro Caec. § 29. He is disparaging the value of Falcula&apos;s evi-
dence. When he gave it, he was asked how many miles {quot tnillia)
Caecina&apos;s farm lay from Rome : and on his replying, mimis iddd, &apos; less
than 50 miles,&apos; with a roar of laughter the audience cried * ipsa esse,&apos;&apos; &apos; the
exact figure!&apos; &apos; For they remembered,&apos; Cic. says, &apos; how much he had
received in the iudicium Albianum.&apos; 33. Qua lege . . . a senatore
ratio repeti solet : this seems to imply that only senators were liable
under the lex [Cornelia] de repetundis, the existing statute on the matter.
So also the words at the beginning of § 148, where Cic. says that if
T. Accius (an eques, v. n. on § 62) were impeached under this law
he would protest &apos; se lege pecuniarum repetundarum non teneri.&apos; (It is
in fact stated in Rab. Post. § 12 that the lex Julia de pecun. repet. did not
apply to the Equites.) But this certainly does not hold in regard to the
WHOLE lex de repetundis : Verr. ii, 2. 77 notices the fact that a non-
senatorial defendant could only challenge three itidices. It is therefore
not unlikely that, as Mr, Peterson conjectures (n. on § 98), the application
of those sections of the law de repetundis which related to judicial corruption
(which seem to appear first in the lex Cornelia de repet. of Sulla, B.C. 81)
was confined to senators, which would be analogous to the similar limita-
tion in the case of the sixth chapter of the lex Cornelia de sicariis (v. infr.
ch. Hv.). When the leges Corneliae were passed all iudices were
senators : but while the lex Aurelia ofB.c. 70 extended the privilege of
judging to other orders, the responsibility for judicial action was (by a
survival, and now an anomaly) still limited to senators. Cp. n. on § 148.^

^ Zumpt&apos;s view somewhat differs from this. He holds that the lex Julia connects
immediately with the lex Calpurnia of b.c. 149: that intermediate laws dealt with
repetundae no\. byitselfbut only in connection with other official offences : that down
to the time of the lex Aurelia of b.c. 70 there was a recognised distinction, acknowledged
by Sulla, between official offences and ordinary offences, and a distinct procedure for
each. Thus the persons liable under the lex Cornelia de repetundis must have been (a)
all senatorial officers, {b) all senators, (c) certain officials whose office was the first step
to promotion. But the lex Julia of Caesar inckided not only senators and senatorial
officers, but also other persons who exercised a share of the state-control. As to Rab.
Post. § 12, he compares ib. § 19, Postumo . . , qui nec tribunus nec praefectus nec ex
Italia comes nec familiaris Gabinii : these words themselves cannot have stood in the
lex Julia : Pompeius had in vain proposed to introduce them (§ 13). But some vague
expression (such as cohors), under which even the knight Postumus might have been
brought, must have stood there. The frr. of the lex Acilia repetundarum support this
view — that officiats, senatorial or equestrian, were liable (Zumpt, Crintinalr. ii. 2. 296).

but identify those who voted non liquet with the nine men here named.

acquitted (§ 76). Eight voted guilty, and were suspected of or charged
with venality afterwards. There were thirty-two jurors in all(§ 74). Thus
ten more must have voted guilty ; and tlie numbers were 14 (9 + 5) for
Opp., 18 against him : if we mayjudge from ih.e. pro Cluent. alone. But
this result is inconsistent with a statement in pro Caec. § 29 : v. Introd.

Quinctius after his tribunate rose * to a higher place,&apos; to the curule aedile-

bought a praetexta to be ready against the aedileship which never came to

before it was thrown over the shoulders — an extravagant size (Marquardt,
Privatleben, p. 538). This must refer to the fashionable toga of the period,
the togafusa, which swept the ground (v. Rich, p. 669), as must our pre-
sent passage. 22. Et iam querimur, &apos; and yet we actually com-
plain ! &apos; v. crit. n. 23. homo novus : ignobilis : nobilitas. The
political distinction between patricians and plebeians had scarcely dis-
appeared when a new division between nobiles and ignobiles appeared.
The former class comprised all who had the ius i?}iaginum, i.e. all (whether
patricians or plebeians) whose fathers or ancestors had held curule office
in the State. (V. Glossary, nobilitas, and n. on § ii, 1. 3, § 72, 1. i.)
This new aristocracy of titled families was for a long time as exclusive and
as close as the old patrician aristocracy ; its claim was less constitutional
and its methods more unscrupulous. Known in politics as the party of
the opiimates, it received its first blow from the Gracchi, and from that
time its serried phalanx was not unfrequently broken by some intruding
novus homo such as Marius and Cicero. (Cp. Mur. § 17.) The novw
homo was the founder of a family — an ignobilis by birth, who had attainea
curule office first of his family — a &apos; self-made man. &apos; Vell. ii. 34 has an
oxymoron : M. Cicero vir novitatis nobilissimae. Consult Ry. Rom. Ant.
p. 67, and an excellent note in Mr. Brooke onSall. lug. ch. v. 25. no-
bilitatis dignitatem virtute tueri : v. Gloss. dignitas. So in Sest. § 98,
otium cum dignitate is the attribute of the conservative optimates, mean-

VI. SixTH : LiTis Aestimatio against Septimius Scaevola, which

WAS NOT A lUDICIUM.

33. A short paraphrase of this somewhat difficult passage may not
be out of place : &apos; Here I am confronted with the litis aestimatio
against S., though it ought not to be adduced as a legal decision. I am
speaking before good lawyers ; and it is not necessary to explain at any
length what a lit. aest. is. But anyhow, the strict care which charac-
terises all other trials is no longer to be expected when once the verdict

XLi. 115] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 163

of guilty has been pronounced. Personal considerations — the fear of
making an enemy — will enter into the problem, and the jury will refuse
to admit a capital charge against the man whom they have condemned ;
or, perhaps, having cleared their consciences by the verdict, they will be
less careful how they make their assessment. Because they are thus lenient
or careless or both [itaque) it will happen that a criminal is rendered Hable
to a fresh charge (such as niaiestas) by the terms of the ///. aest., but acquitted
when brought to his trialon it : or, again, a third party is implicated in the
lit. aest. as the recipient of money embezzled, and acquitted when sepa-
rately tried. Such a conflict of sentences is no upsetting of legal
decisions j it is simply an assertion of the principle that a litis
aestimatio is not the same thing as a itidicium&apos; 7. litem eo

nomine esse aestimatam : the following passage does not give us
a very full explanation of the litis aestimatio, nor, as Cicero pro-
fesses to be addressing experts, can we expect it, and there is no reason
(with Ry.) to suspect the text. In cases of repetundae or peculatus the
litis aestlmatio was as distinct from the iudiciuin or verdict of guilty or
not guilty as is the verdict of the jury from the sentence of the judge with
us. It was (according to Rah. Post. § 8) quasi appendicula causae iudi-
catae atque damnatae. (i.) It was the process by which, in the case of
certain offences in which the punishment admitted of as many degrees as
the offence, all the details of the penalty were adjusted : on what score
{quo nomine) compensation was to be made, to what persons, in what
amount. (ii.) Besides this specification of the degree of the offence, a
different complexion might be given to the offence in the course of the
investigation. * The /. aest. was not a mere assessment of damages, but
might also contain a statement that the accused was guilty of an ofifence
which should be tried under another quaestio. &apos; Pseudo- Ascon. on Verr.
i. 39, litis aestimationem fieri non solum ex titulo propositi criminis sed
etiam ex aliis probationibus quae ex ante actis rebus apud iudices con-
stiterint (quoied by Prof. Nettleship in P.). (iii.) More than this, other
persons might be incriminated, and might be called up to defend them-
selves against the imputation made upon them. These three points are
illustrated in the text, § 116, lines 4-8, 8-10, 10-13. ^s there was
nothing repugnant to Roman notions of justice in the idea of taking
other offences into account, besides that charged, in convicting a man,
so it was also in sentencing him (though here English practice accords).
And as the litis aestimatio might lead to a trial and condemnation
on another charge (notified in the assessment upon the original charge)
he might presumably suffer twice for the same ofifence. [It will be
well to collect the main references to litis aestimatio upon which
the above statement is based : — (i.) Pseudo-Ascon. Verr. i. § 38, hoc est
pecunia de qua lis fuit, et propter quam condemnatus est, in summam
redacta, quae de eius rebus exigeretur : * This denotes the money, on
account of which the case was tried and the defendant convicted, brought

up to a fixed sum to be levied upon his goods.&apos; Also Cic. Verr. l.c, an
important passage as to Septimius : quid sit quod P. Septimio senatore
damnato, Q. Hortensio praetore de pecuniis repetundis lis aestimata sit
eo nomine^ quod ille ob rem iudicandam pecuniam accepisset : &apos; [The
Roman people shall hear from me] why it is that when P. Septimius, a
senator, was found guilty in the court in which Q. Hortensius as praetor
tried cases of extortion, the damages were assessed on this count, that he
had taken a bribe as a juror.&apos; Verr. ii. i. 95, hoc scitote cum iste civita-
tibus frumentum coria . . . imperaret neque ea sumeret proque his rebus
pecuniam exigeret, his nominibus soHs Cn. Dolabellae HS ad triciens

hides, etc. , from the states, and in lieu of these, which he would not take,
required payment in money, on these counts alone damages to the amount
of 3,000,000 sesterces were assessed against Cn. Dolabella.&apos; He goes on
to quote the heading of the /. aest. &apos; de litibus aestimatis cn. dola-

being &apos; completely at variance with the tenor of Cicero&apos;s observa-
tions. . . . Far from being an illustration of the careless leniency of
jurors, it would rather be a proof of vindictive persecution.&apos; But Cic.
argues, not that jurors are always lenient in lit. aest., but that they are
always careless, and that sometimes in the way of severity (as in the case
of Scaevola), sometimes in that of leniency. The leniency, of which
Ry. sees an additional proof in the next sentence (et hoc cotidie . . .),
was that of iudices in a iudicium, not of iudices in a lit. aest. It is because
jurors are negligent in a lit. aest. that this process does not carry the
weight of a iudicium : brought to the test of the latter, it sometimes
proves itself a &apos; brutum fulmen &apos;: indeed the selfsame iudices acting in

censors in B.c. 70, the office being revived ; Sulla had left it in abeyance.
They signalised themselves by excluding 74 senators. 28. cum altero,

118. — 30. subscriptio : in affixing the mark {nota) the censor was ex-
pected to assign in writing his reason for doing so [subscribere^ § 119, 1. 12).
Hence subscriptio is the technical term for the censor&apos;s stigma. (Ry.
Rom. Ant. p. 168.) Aulus Gellius (iv. 20) gives two amusing instances.
The censor put a man upon his oath in the formula, * ut tu ex animi tui
sententia uxorem habes ? &apos; &apos; Do you take your oath in good faith, that you
have a wife?&apos; The man could not miss an opportunity, and repHed,
&apos;habeo equidem, sed non hercle ex animi mei sententia^ &apos; I have, but not
to my liking.&apos; For this ill-timed levity he was disfranchised, * causamque
hanc ioci scurrihs apud se dicti [censor] subscripsit.&apos; Another, who ap-
peared at the review of &apos; knights with a public horse,&apos; a lean ill-groomed
beast, while he himself looked sleek and plump, was asked by the censor
&apos; why he was better kept than his horse ? &apos; He replied, &apos; Because I groom
myself, but my good-for-nothing slave Statius grooms my horse.&apos; This
wag was similarly &apos; in aerarios relatus,&apos; his want of respect being alleged
in the &apos; subscriptio &apos; appended to the nota. 32. ratione censoria : v.
Glossary. Ratio denotes abstract theory as opposed to facts, viz.
the conduct of those particular censors. 33. a Lentulo : the reserva-

Geta we have the following notice in Valerius Maximu^, quoted by Ry. :
C. Geta cum a L. Metello et Cn. Domitio censoribus senatu motus esset,
postea censor factus est. Metellus and Domitius were censors B.C. 115,
and removed from the senate ; C. Licinius Geta, consul b.c. 116, and
afterwards censor B.c. 108. * There are plenty of examples, not only of
persons thus noiati attaining office afterwards (as Mamercus Aemilius, Liv.
iv. 31. 5, and C. Geta), but of their attaining it while the nota was still
operative,&apos; that is, before ib.elustrum inaugurated by the same censors ex-
pired. By gaining office the notatus regained his place in the senate.
Cic. de Rep. 4. 6, censoris iudicium nihil fere damnato nisi ruborem adfert.
Itaque ut omnis ea iudicatio versatur tantummodo in noniine, animadversio
illa ignominia dicta est : an important reference, as showing that, at any
rate for Cicero&apos;s time, the substantial penalties whxh the censor could
inflict were (if any) very small. V. Ry. Rovi. Ant. p. 169 ; Momms.

important of their duties, v. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 168. Cp. Cic. de leg. iii.

Pis. § 10, quam potestatem (censoriam) minuere, quominus de moribus

penes eam regimen, in senatu equitumque centuriis decoris dedecorisque

praefectus moribus. 20. turpi iudicio . . . ignominia : infamia was
the result of a ttirpe iudicitim, ignoininia of the subscriptio of the censor
The former was the more serious and permanent. Conviction in a turpe
iudicium (such 2&amp;furtu7n, v. infra ; iniuria, assault orlibel ; dolus mahis,
fraud) was one of the things which disqualified a man for ever standing for
public office. But condemnation in an ordinary criminal process was not
enough to do this, nor was the imminence of a serious charge, unless
the presiding magistrate ruled it so (as in the canvass of Catilina,
B.c. 66). As to the censorial nota, probably it did suffice to disqualify, as
long as it was taken seriously : but for this period Cicero&apos;s argument
in these chapters (xlii. xliii.) shows that this was no longer the case.

stances the famous quarrel of M. Livius Salinator and C. Claudius Nero,
censors in B.C. 204, who marked and degraded each other. Mommsen
emphasises the exceptional sanction required for the censorial nota :
whereas generally each member of an official collegium is invested with
the whole of the powers of that collegium unless a collega interposes a veto,
in this matter the positive co-operation of the collega is necessary : his mere
acquiescence is not enough : the nota must represent the two censors acting
in concert. In contrast with a discors censura such as this passage de-
scribes, cp. Liv. xlv. 15. 8, omnes eidem ab utroque et tribu moti et aerarii
facti, neque uUius, quem alter notaret, ab altero levata ignominia. V. Ry.
Rom. Ant. p. 169; Momms. R. Staatsr. i.^ 278, ii. i. 345. 19. ut
alter . . . vetet : the censor by his noia either movet senatti, or equum
adimit (cp. § 134 infr.), or tribu movet. Now, as to the third of these, we
must distinguish between the operation of the censor&apos;s action in an earlier
and in a later period. The transition from the former to the latter is
marked by the censorship of Appius Claudius Caecus, B.C. 312, who allowed
landless citizens and freedmen to be enrolled in the tribes : supplementing
this reform, in b.c. 304, the censor C. Fabius Rullianus confined landless
citizens to the four city tribes ; the same was afterwards done with freed-
men. In the former of these periods we have tribules paying a trihutum
on landed property, and, opposite to them, aerarii taxed on personal pro-
perty. The latter have no ius suffragii, and in consequence no ius
konorum: their only political privilege is to pay taxes. (A third class
consisted of the capite censi, who had no property to show, and therefore
could not be taxed.) In the latter period the tributum was raised on
property of all kinds, landed or personal : citizenship, not landed owner-
ship, was the qualification for membership in a tribus. Thus the dis-
tinction between tribules and aerarii (using the words in their old sense)
disappears. A new distinction appears instead. There is now a higher
class, who pay taxes on their land ; and a lower class, who are taxed
on their personalty. The former constitute the country tribes, the latter

170 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XLiv. 123

(together with freedmen and capite censi) the four city tribes. — There
is a corresponding change in the operation of the censor&apos;s nota. In the
earlier period, by placing a man among the aerarii they disfranchised
him. In the later period, the old navie is retained, in aerarios referre,
but now it signifies not a loss of tribe, but a change of tribe. The
censor moves a man from a country into a city tribe ; one so moved
is called an aerarius still, but he retains the ius suffragii, ius honorum
(cp. n. on § 119, 1. 15), and right to serve in the army. Thus it is
that Cicero can say, censoris iudicium nihil fere damnato nisi ruborem
adfert, de Rep. 4. 6. (Momms. R. Staatsr. ii. 390-393, 402-404.)
When Cicero says in aerarios referre aut tribu movere, he is instancing
two cases of censorial action, which are, for his own time at any rate,
identical. 20. Anoiher phrase equivalent to in aerarios referre is

in tabulas Caeritum referre ; v. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 82 for the ordinary
explanation of the term. Cp. Hor. Ep. i. 6. 62, Caerite cera digni,
* men who have lost caste.&apos; For the act. inf. referre v. crit. n.

24. inter collegas discrepare : we can say, * haec res inter quosdam dis-
crepat,&apos; or * de hac re inter quosdam discrepat &apos; : although the imper-
sonal use is the more common. This is frequent in Greek : e.g. apK^crd)
dp-^a-Kova^ eyib, Soph. Ant. 547, for the impersonal, &apos;it will sufhce that
I die.&apos; Cp. also § 104, quae praeiudicia constarent.

XLIV. 123.— 28. quia subscripserint : contrast the mood inp. 47, 1. 3,
^uia verum est. The alternative proposed is — Is it true because the
censors have formally alleged it, or did they allege it because it was
true ? in fact, &apos;isit true on the censor&apos;s authority, or is it trueinfact?&apos;
In either member the appropriate mood is used : Cic. passes from the
region of opinion (si statuimus ita esse quia subscripse^-ifit, suboblique
subj.) to the region of fact {quod subscriptum est, quia verum est, indic. of
categorical assertion). 30. quid agatis and ne . . . permittatis

both depend directly on videte, &apos; take care &apos; : cp. § 97, vide ne mea

in maintaining that the iudicium notioque censoria [Pis. § 10 : cp. n.
on § 117) was not a iudicium in the same sense as a trial before a
quaestio. At the same time certain formalities, approaching in character
to those of such a trial, had to begone through before the censoraffixed his
nota. The person incriminated was summoned, formally accused (cp. si
qui contra dicere vellet, § 134), and allowed the services of an advocate,
before the censors pronounced sentence. Only, compliance with those for-
malities depended on the censors&apos; will and pleasure : herein lay the distinc-
tion from a iudicium proper. In the present passage Cic. seems to imply that

stmulasset, instructam ei . . . tabernam dedit ; Verr. i. § 1 1 , eum, cui
legatus . . . fuisset in invidiam adduxit. In the latter case it may be
more convenient to call the relative concessive ( = quamvis ei). The
indic. simply asserts the fact as it is, the subj. expresses the connec-
tion of this fact with others. The former is more usual when the qui-
clause follows, the latter when it precedes, the principal verb : cp. two

aerarium facere {R. Staatsr. ii. 388 n. ), quoting Liv. xxix. 37, which
runs thus : exitu censurae, cum in leges iurasset C. Claudius, inter nomina
eorum. quos aerarios relinquebat dedit collegae nomen. Deinde M. Livius
. . . xxxiv tribus aerarios reliquit . . . Inter xxxiv tribus et C. Claudium
aerarium fore. Earlier in the chapter we are told that either censor bade
the other equum vendere : surely this was aerariumfacere, and the action
aerariiim relinquere, marking the close of the censor&apos;s term of office {exitu
c), is a confirmation of this act, &apos; to leave a man among the aerarii, where
he was already.&apos; We should expect aer. facere to have been used of M.
Livius&apos; wholesale visitation : but as it was done in retaliation for the act
of C. Claudius, and done just before the censor gave up the registers, the
same phrase is used of it. In another passage, de Off. i. 40, a similar
phrase (which Momms. says &apos;is dififerent &apos;), in aerariis relinquere, occurs. It
is used of the punishment of ten Roman prisoners of Hannibal, who broke
their parole and stayed at Rome. As, prisoners, they were already capite
deminuti, hence it can be said &apos; eos censores, quoad quisque eorum vixit

. . . in aer. reliquerunt.&apos;&apos; This seems an exact equivalent of inter
aerarios relinquere (Liv. l.c.) [Dr. Holden says, wrongly as I take
it, *m aer. reliq. i.q. aerarios fecerunt.&apos;&apos;&apos;^ Momms. R. Staatsr. ii. 388 n.
[Mr. Roby so far agrees with this view as to hold that the phrase aer.
relinq. expresses the effect of the censors&apos; action rather than the action
itself.]

negotio legem timere, cum eam in maiore neglegeris ? &apos; What consistency

32. idem has strong adversative force sometimes, especially when in
apposition to the subject of the sentence. The identity of the agent
heightens the contrast of the actions. So Hor. C. ii. lo. 15, informes
hiemes reducit | lupiter, idem | summovet. Cp. § 112, procedit
saepe longius quam si zdem ille esset cum isdem suis vitiis nobilissimus,
where the contrast is between vitiosus et ignobilis and vitiosus et nobilis :
also § 92, § 137. Sometimes the force of zdem is merely augmentative,
like e^tam : Hor. C. ii. 10. 22 ; de Off. i. § 43, nihil liberale quod non

being the use oi plup. and sometimes imperf. subj. in Livy and later writers
to denote cases frequently occurring (&apos; whenever &apos;) : R. 1716, r. 721. But
in other cases, if the subj. ever occurs, it requires some special explanation :

1. 19. magister veteris d. et s., &apos; a graduate in the stern school of

oportuit : the use of the perf. inf. after oportet is confined to the Comic
poets and Cic, and seems to have been colloquial. Its use after verbs of
desiring (especially volo) is analogous, and is also seldom to be found in
authors other than Cic and the Com. poets. Cp. § 90, accusatum oportuit
(note and reff.). Originally the tehse of the inf. had its full meaning of
C077ipleted action : cp. § 13, filium interfectum cupit. But in cases such as
this it is indistinguishable in translation from the pres. inf., though it may
lend a tone of impatience or peremptoriness to the expression. This
usage is commonest in the passive voice, the auxiHary esse being generally
omitted : Verr. ii. 4. 37, signum ablatum non oportuit ; Catil. ii. § 27,
illos . . . monitos etiam atque etiam volo. We may also cp. the use of
the past part. with opus in such expressions as properato opus est. R.

proceeding. There is an exaggeration contained in negat : Lentulus had

not expressed an opinion either one way or the other. i8. quod erat
libertini filius : from the time of Appius Claudius the censor (b.c. 312)
the grandsons of freedmen ceased to be ineligible for office and for a seat
in the senate ; not so the so7ts of freedmen. (Thus in the Fasti the names
of a magistrate&apos;s father and grandfather are all but invariably given, e.g.
L. Cornelius Gn. f. Gn. n. Scipio : a slave-grandfather could not be
named). Cp. Hor. Sertn. i. 6. 20, censorque moveret | Appius, ingenuo
si non essem patre natus. But the old predilection for one v^^hose family
was freeborn for at least two generations back still remained. (This is
Mommsen&apos;s view, after Suetonius : most supposed that Appius admitted
freedmen&apos;s sons : v. /^om. Staatsr. i.^ 459, 460.) 19. locum quidem
. . . liberat. This is an early instance of the bestowal of those orna-
menta (&apos;insignia of fictitious &apos; or titular &apos; magistracy, &apos; as Momms. calls
them), which generally, hke the ornamenta triMmpkalia^ gave much more
of the show of power than of its substance, and were therefore in later times
a frequent mark of imperial favour. They answered variously to different
magistracy, being quaestoria (as probably in this cdiSe), praetoria, etc, as
the case might be. If a man was a senator, the bestowal of ornamenta
quaestoria, praetoria, etc, would entitle him to take his place among the
quaestorii, praetorii, etc, in the senate ; they did 7iot, however, count for
the realities (quaestorship, etc), in the gradus honorufu, or scale of official
promotion. If a man was not a senator, they did not confer a seat in the
senate : what they did give him was a certain style and certain insignia.
At public festivals he might sit among the senators, he shared their
banquets, he wore their garb. In the present instance we find them

no fault of his own. V. Momms. R. St. i.^ 440-446, and Gloss. ornamen-

&apos; Sacerdos, et lucrifac censoriam notam [&apos;think yourself kicky to have
escaped the stigma &apos;] ne ego in tua persona et accusatoris et testis et iudicis
partes egisse videar &apos; : it will be instructive to compare the itaHcised ex-
pressions with the corresponding ones in the text. Notice also how distinct
in the censor&apos;s mind the prekminary investigation and the consequent
sentence (notatio) are from one another : cp. n. on § 126. 8. in
equitum censu : this was also called equitum recensus, or eq. recognitio :
&apos;tTnriojv i^eraaLS, Plut. It must be distinguished from the census populi^ as
being, formally at any rate, a military inspection of a standing force, and
not of a mere miktia. The knights of the eig;hteen centuries all passed
under review in single file, as their names were called by the crier {cilati).
Each presents himself personally before the censors, leading his horse by
the halter ; and according as they are satisfied or dissatisfied as to his
abihty for active service, the condilion of his horse,^ and the number ofhis
campaigns, he is bidden to pass on with his horse or to sell it : or he may
be punished by a loss of allowances in case of a slight offence. Unlike the
census populi, which was held (as a contio) in the Campus Martius, the
census equitum took place in the Forum. V. Momms. R. St. ii. i. 348,

IX. NiNTHLY: A Senatus consultum referring in general

TERMS TO THE JUNIANUM lUDICIUM.

XLIX, 136. — 32. The senate might, in the case of some exceptional
offence for the punishment of which the law did not expressly provide, pass
aresolution that a special commission should be appointed todeal with it :
* ut extra ordinem de facinore quaereretur &apos; : if the people ratified this
resolution, a special bill was brought in to regulate the trial. Ry. refers
to the measures adopted after the death of Clodius for the impeachment
of Milo, B.C. 52 (Ascon. argum. pro Milon. ; Momms. iv. 2, p. 325) :
Pompey, named sole consul at the instance of the senate, by his law *de
vi &apos; constituted a special quaestio for the trial of Milo. The Varian qtiaes-
tio which tried the adherents of Drusus, B.c. 90, and that which tried the
accomplices of Jugurtha, B.C. 109, were similar : except that they were not
established at the suggestion of the senate. In the present instance the
senate suggests, but the magistrates do not act upon the suggestion.
33. Suscepit causam : contrast causam recipere, § 68 with note. Au
has its proper force here : it implies the needlessness of the previous re-
mark — &apos; (Was it not compelled to take it up ?) or could it have refused

on the ground of statements in the Digest, that the lex Cornelia de falsis (for
which V. § 125 n.) contained a clause against any person who took orgave
a bribe in a criminal case. The present passage makes against this view.
It was necessary, we see, for the senate to call for a special court of

i8o EXPLANATORY NOTES. [xLix. 137

nquiry into the conduct of those who were suspected of bribing jurors.
(Cp. n. on 1. 32 supr.) Whereas the case of those who had taken bribes
was covered by the lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis and lex de repetundis.
The argument of Zumpt, that this resolution of the senate threatened the
latter class, and not the former, because C. Junius found himself imperilled,
cannot go for much. Any investigation of the facts was presumably
dangerous to him in its uUimate, even if not in its immediate, conse-
quences. There was therefore no existing statute which dealt (expressly
and without distinction of persons) with the offence of those who had
bribed. In two ways only could justice be set in motion against them.
The offender might (as inthe case of Cluentius) be accused under the sixth
chapter of the lex Corneha de sic. et veneficis : but here a non-senator
might escape on the technical plea. Or the senate might call for a special
inquiry against him. (Cp. Fritzsche, Sull. Gesetzg. 25.) Mr. Roby,

however, thinks that this s.c. was directed against all who took part in
corrupting a jury : cp. the language used of C. Junius in § 92 : and that
therefore there is no clear inference from this to the contents of the lex
Cornelia. 8. &apos; Is this, upon the face of it, a decision of the senate

had devolved the same duty by decree.&apos; The consuls should have moved
the appointment of a quaestio in accordance with the suggestion of the
senate. The construction decernere in aliquein is not found elsewhere
with this meaning. 17. quod H, pecunia factum esse arguis is the
subject to factum est . . . illorum aequitate, as the chiastic arrangement
and the virtual repetition of factum est shows : thus the clause ut . . .
arbitrarentur is appended as an explanation of the subject. The sentence
neque id . . . conflrmas is thrown in, attached loosely to quod . . .
factum esse arguis : Cic. might have written neque . . . confirmas instead,
carrying on quod . . . factum esse as object. Similarly a relative is
sometimes continued in a second clause by a demonstrative or personal
pronoun, especially where the case changes : as in Hom. Od. ix. 19, ef/x&apos;

that they need not afterwards submit to the people a decree which the
senate had passed for the sake of quenching the flames of a momentary

law-courts the accused might eke out his defence by every method of appeal
to the compassion of his judges. In the farcical trial of the dog in the
Wasps of Aristophanes, its puppies are produced to excite the pity of the
court by their &apos; whining prayers and tears,&apos; 1. 977. Cp. also the use of

L. — 30. A list of the previous utterances of Cicero, which have a bear-
ing on the present case, may be useful : most of them will be found quoted
in the Notes and Introduction — in Verr. i. § 29, i. §§ 38, 39, ii. i. 157,

causes of offence giveji by the courts (subjective gen.). The plural of
abstract substantives (especially those denoting mental affections) is used
to denote (a) the occasions of the exercise of the affection, e.g. laudes,
* praiseworthy deeds &apos; (/awi^^praiseworthiness), formidines, amores (&apos;the
beloved object,&apos; always plur.) libidines ; {b) the expressions oi the affection
in question, e.g. dolores, gaudia (&apos; expressions of pain, triumph&apos;), audaciae,
furores (&apos; deeds of boldness, frenzy &apos;). But often the plural of these verbs
is only intensive, as animi, spiritus, irae. We have another use again in
§ 56, conscientias facinorum, on which v. n. 12. Sed errat veHemen-
ter, cet. This is the least skilful part of Cicero&apos;s defence. His previous
utterances were directly opposed to his present contention ; they might be
got rid of in one of two ways : (a) by a timid line of defence — a partial
admission of their falsity. * An advocate is not speaking ex cathedra (as
a responsible statesman does) or on his oath as a witness. The exigencies
of the case and time determine his choice of facts. He is bound not to
say what he knows to be false ; he is not bound only to say what he knows
to be true.&apos; In fact Cic. might admit that his utterances were ex re
causaque\lucta. {b) By a bolder line of defence : that of simple recanta-
tion. &apos; On the question of fact I was wrong, I was misled : but I may
now claim credit for a mind open to reason, which I ask the jury to
exhibit.&apos; In fact, Cic.&apos;s utterances (he might say) were non cognita.
There can be little question that the latter (as Ry. says) was the only safe
line of apology. The former is double-edged : the jury, if perversely
logical, might apply to the present speech the principle which they are
invited to apply to previous speeches. Yet Cic. adopts the former of the

L. 140] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 183

arguments, though he works round in § 142 to the latter, which, however,
even then he rather toys with than adopts. How can we account for his
choice ? Perhaps it is best explained by his weakness of character, espe-
cially as this appeared in political timidity. In poHtics (§ 141) requiritur
constaiitia. To take the bolder ground would be to confess that the
party-cry of B.c. 74-70 rested on facts so called, the most signal of which
was untrue. So though the whole contention of ihe speech is a denial of
the truth of that fact, he cannot frame his lips to deny it here in so many
words. He dare not confess to his inconsistency. He prefers the glaring
sophismof§ 139, that &apos; in his speeches it is not he that speaks, but his
client&apos;s case personified &apos; ! Thus the politician gets ihe better of the advo-
cate, and the case suffers. Certainly the &apos; causa Cluenti,&apos; if allowed to speak
for itself, would not have chosen this line of defence. A wise advocate
would scarcely disclaim all personal conviction as to the argument which he
adopts. 14. auct. nostras consignatas, &apos; the certified declaration of

my views.&apos; V. Glossary, auctoritas. 15. causarum, not a mere gen. of
connection or possession, &apos; appropriate to the case and moment &apos; : but

ments.&apos; The orator is the mere mouthpiece of the case. Thus only can
the connection with the next senlence (nam, si . . . ) be explained.

taught man, who owed everything to his excellent memory, natural viva-
city, and quick imagination, and whose chief merit lay in his brilliant
delivery : [omnium eloquentissimus quos ego viderim ; Tusc. v. § 55 :]
Crassus, a man of acute intellect and juridical training, hence as an orator
less taking than Antonius, but persuasive through his lucid explanations,
and winning through merry wit and elegant language &apos; (Teuffel, R. Lit.
§ 139). M. Antonius was grandfather of the triumvir. He was murdered
by the followers of Marius and Cinna, B.c. Z^. 20. nullam . . .

Martius, capital of the province of Galha Narbonensis (in S.E. France,
between the Cevennes and Alps, answering to the provinces of Languedoc,
Dauphine, and Provence), was colonised by the consul Q. Martius
Rex, B.c. 118, and was the first transmarine colony with citizen-rights.
The senate opposed its foundation. Ry. quotes Font. § 13, est in eadem
provincia Narbo Martius, specula populi Romani ac propugnaculum istis
ipsis nationibus oppositum et obiectum. Pag&quot;e 64, 1. I. The lex
Servilia of Q. Servilius Caepio, B.c. 106, was a proposal to restore the
jury-courts to the senate (cum Serviliae leges senatui iudicia redderent ;

versation. They are coupled in de Orat. i. § 17, lepos and sal in ib. ii.
§ 98. Lepos seems here to denote &apos; wit &apos; &apos;,facetiae &apos; humour &apos; or &apos; playful-
ness &apos; as a pervading quality. A similar distinction is that drawn by Cic.
himself between facetiae and dicacitas {Orat. §§ 87-90) : the former con-
sists &apos; in narrando aliquid venuste,&apos; the latter &apos; in iaciendo mittendoque
ridiculo &apos; : the former is &apos; maioris artis,&apos; the latter &apos; acrioris ingenii.&apos; Cp.

use of the balneum (balneae) instead of the simpler arrangements of earlier
times came in with other Hellenising fashions ; the word itself is Greek,
^aXaveioi/. The sing. generally denotes a private bath, the plur. a public
one, but neither use is invariable. Public baths were erected by the
community, or else (as those of Brutus) by a speculator, and then let out to
a lessee ; they were under the supervision of the aediles. Other instances
of baths belonging to speculators are the b. Seniae {Cael. § 61), b. Palla-
cinae {Rosc. Am. § 18). V. L. and Sh. balneum ; Momms. Marq. Rdmi

levied from the citizen body to form two consular armies, and disbanded
at the end of their campaign, unless further required, as was the case in
the SecondTunic War, in which at one time twenty-three legions were
serving. The legions were numbered : the four regular legions of the
year being ranked first. The army did not, as in imperial times, supply
young men with a profession, but with a stepping-stone to pubHc office.
From the year B.c. 207, the twenty-four miHtary tribunes required for the
four &apos; first legions &apos; ceased to be nominees of the consuls, and were elected
by the comitia tributa from the senatorial or equestrian order. The
tribunes for any other legions were named stiU by the consuls. The
former tribunes were distinguished from them as tribuni militum a poptdo.

Sulla in the lex Cornelia de sicariis. Under this law C. Gracchus had
constituted a new quaestio. We need not (with Ry. ) suppose this lex
Sempronia to have been passed before the transfer of iudicia to the equites.
It probably was directed mainly against the administrative jurisdiclion of
the senate, by which that body at times, as in the case of the BacchanaHa,
might appoint an extraordinary commission to try offences of treason.
Momms. {Hist. Eng, tr. iii. p. 118) suggests that it may have been
identical with the law de provocatione, which afifirmed anew the principle
of appeal to the people. Zumpt, again, supposes that this Sempronian
law, providing for the control of magistrates, was not confined to those
cases in which the penalty was capital\ the expression iudicio circumven-
iretur being perfectly general. He supposes Sulla to have adopted it with
a limitation to capital cases {Crimiualrecht, ii. 2. 29-31). 30. adligare :
V. Gloss. 33. &apos; He would have concentrated in this single court all the
venom of his proscription as he viTcaked it upon the former jurors.&apos;
The law, as re-enacted by Sulla, dealt with judicial corruption, and still
applied to senatorial &apos;yxxox?&gt; only. Cicero says here that Sulla would have
made its action retrospective, or, in other words, extended its apphcation
to the equites, had he dared to do so, proscriptionis : in which

40 senators and 1600 knights perished. — Appian {b. c. i, 95), Momms.
R. Hist. iii. p, 351 n.

152. — Page 59, 1. 3. &apos; The one object in view is to draw the equestrian
order into the clutches of this statute.&apos; In this and the two following
sections Cic. deals, as well as he can, with the very fair contention of Accius,
that all jurors (whether senators, knights, or tribuni afirarii) should be
ruled to be upon the same footing of legal responsibihty. His reply may
be resolved into a positive argument (§ 152, beginning of § 153) and a
negative argument (§§ 153, 154). {a) The positive argument is as follows :
If a clause involving the equites were introduced it would be abused.
Senators who are strong in the consciousness of their own rectitude are

LVi. 153] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 191

willing to allow the equites an immunity in law which they enjoy them-

selves in fact. It is the unworthy members of the senate who demand the

change : those who insist that if any order in the state shall have carte

blanche to do what it likes, that order shall be their own, expect thus to

possess themselves of a threat with which to intimidate the equestrian

iudices who might expose.them. [We may remark that Cic. blinks the

fact that iudicia are not composed of equites alone, or senators alone : to

make the equestrian jurors responsible is not to make the senatorial jurors

irresponsible. As easily, under existing arrangements, might a guilty eques

intimidate senatorial jurors. In fact the true conckision is — the change is

demanded by all who know the dangers of irresponsible power, no

matter to whom committed, but Cic, liaving confused the issue, hastens

on to other ground before ihis objection can take shape in the minds

of his hearers,] {b) Negative argument, on the principle of &apos;quietS

non movere.&apos; The balance of power between the two orders still,

as in the days of M. Drusus, maintains the equilibrium of the state.

5. integritate, &apos;honesty&apos;: cp. § 133, de huius pudore integritate virtute.

7. cupiditate, not, as in §66, &apos; party-spirit,&apos; but simply *greed&apos;; sine

cupid. =integritate above. V. n. on cupidiore, §66. equites ordini

senatorio dignitate proximos, concordia coniunctissimos : these words

are interesting as an anticipation of Cicero&apos;s political creed enunciated

a few years after this time. In the coalition of senators and equites (&apos; causa

optima,&apos; ad Att. ii. l6. 4) he hoped to find a counterpoise to the growing

forces of democracy soon to issue (though Cic. was too short-sighted

to perceive it) in Caesarism. Cp. his resume of his speech made

after Pompeius&apos;s return from the East : haec erat {fTr6de&lt;ns : de gravitate

ordinis [sc. senatorii], de equestri concordia^ cet. 8. sese volunt

posse omnia: the infin. after verbs of wishing has a pronominal subject {volo

me esse), when it is desired to throw out the whole idea, thus conveyed,

as something distinct and contemplated already as if it were realised :

G. iv. 238, et spicula caeca relinquunt ] adfixae venis, animasque in

LVI. 153. — 20. In B.c. 91, the tribune, M. Livius Drusus, attempted
to purify the law-courts by two important measures : the iudices, instead
of being taken from the equites alone, were to be chosen from the senate,
which was to be enlarged by tlie admission of 300 equites ; and, secondly,
there was to be a special quaestio for the trial of jurors who had been or
should be guilty of accepting bribes (Momms. R. H. iii. 222). The
latter law, being thus retrospective, was fiercely attacked by the equites,
and was, with Drusus&apos;s other proposals, speedily rejected on the ground

Hor. C. iii. 14. 18. The Samnites in this war showed themselves the
irreconcilable enemies of Rome, and after it joined in the revolution of
Marius and Cinna; but were finally crushed by Sulla, B.C. 82, in the
battle of the Colline Gate and subsequent massacre. 16. sectoribus,
&apos; wholesale purchasers &apos; : a word of disputed origin. The property of one
proscribed was sold by auction (sub hasta), as being that of a public enemy
(hostis), and in the lump. Such a sale was called sectio, and the purchaser
sector. Gaius says, &apos; sectores vocantur qui publica bona mercantur. &apos; Two
derivations are suggested : — (i.) The grammarians explain it &apos;sectatores
bonorum,&apos; connecting it with sequi or secare = s,eqm. (Nonius, p. 404,
secare sequi, unde et sectatores bonorum sectores dicti sunt : quoting Verg.
A. X. 107, quam quisque secat spem.) The course of meaning would be
follow^ petition, purckase. Expressions for buying and selling are vague
at first, then become definite : enio originally meant &apos; to take &apos; (cp. adimo,
etc.) : to purchase meant &apos; to acquire &apos; : irpiaadai., &apos; to have a thing
brought across&apos;(sea for sale). (ii.) From seco, &apos; to cut,&apos; Explained in
two ways : (a) because the purchaser divided up what he had bought, and
sold it in lots. But this is by no means of the essence of the word. R.
Am. § 103, declares the sector to be &apos; bonorum emptor atque possessor.^
[Mr. Roby however thinks that the word sector from secare may well have
denoted the position originally, although the purchaser did remain in
possession for a time.] {b) according to Mommsen, one who &apos;cuts off&apos; a
percentage from the gross value on account of the encumbrances on the
property, gives, e.g. 80 per cent. instead of cent. per cent. This is far-
fetched. A full and satisfactory discussion of the words sector and secare
( = sequi) may be found in Prof. Nettleship, Essays, p. 369 sqq. We may
add that in Lucan, i. 178, sectorque favoris | ipse sui populus, the word
means &apos; seller. &apos; Terms of buying are sometimes confused with those
of selling: compare Cheapside, chapman, Lat. caupo (§ 163), with
Germ. kaufen (buy). In the days of barter there was little or no difference
between buying and selling.

{c) Cluentius has taken the property of Ennius.

163. — 19. calumniator : v. Gloss. 21. cum servls furti egit :

valent to accuso, is used with the gen. of the thing charged : cp. Caec.
§ 35, an ages iniuriarum ? Cp. n. on § 97, maiestatis (condemnatus).
An accus. of the person is also found : Liv. xxiv. 25, tanquam reos ageret ;
cp. iv. 42, si reum perago. 22. illo privato iudicio, viz., the trial for
theft, which, strangely enough, was a civil suit at Rome : v. Ry. R. Ant.

Gloss. on calumnia. ) * Believe me, the said civil action must involve
him in the criminal penalties of calumny, even though he too will per-
haps enjoy the advantage of your able advocacy. &apos; It must be remembered
that calumnia was a iudicium publicum : thus Cic. implies that Ennius,
like Shylock in the Duke&apos;s Court, would find the tables turned upon him.
From being claimant in a civil suit, he is to become defendant in a criminal
trial. 24. hominem multorum hospitum : for the gen. v. crit. n.

* That man of hospitality, Ambivius, the innkeeper of the Latin Way. &apos;
The Via Latina ran through Latium as far as Beneventum in Samnium,
where it joined the Via Appia. Cp. § 192. 27. &apos; It is still unnecessary,&apos;
i.e. &apos;atpresent it is unnecessary to speak.&apos; 28. Si invitaverit . . .
decessisse : it is not easy either to translate or to explain this play upon
words. Ry. and P. both say that travellers were said decedere de via
when they turned in to an inn by the roadside, upon what authority I do
not know ; devertere is * to turn in &apos; or &apos; put up at &apos; a place, and also ad-
mits of being used metaphorically (v. L. and Sh.). Why then did not
Cic. say devertissel However, upon that view we should tr. &apos; If he gives
us an invitation, we shall entertain him in such a way that he will regret
ever having left the high-road. &apos; But de via decedere has only one meaning,
&apos;to go out of the way,&apos; and with the dat. *to make way for&apos;: cp. the
famous &apos; salutari appeti decedi assurgi, &apos; de Senect. § 63. And it is as host
still that Ambivius de via decedit : this is far more probable than his
sudden conversion into guest or traveller. So Sylvius rightly explains

* caupones ut hospites invitent, de via non numquam decedunt.&apos; * If he
gives us his professional invitation, we shall give him such a warm recep-
tion that he will rue the day he left his Road &apos; or * went out ofthe Way for
us.&apos; Of Ambivius as accuser, the expression means &apos; left the Latin Way
for Rome &apos; : of Ambivius, as landlord, &apos; made way for us to enter his
house,&apos; or perhaps &apos;went out of his way to ask us in.&apos; In fact there is a
pun on via. Similar is the expression de Fin. v. § 5, paullum ad
dexteram de via declinavi, ut ad Pericli sepulchrum accederem.

you see in court, son of my client&apos;s sister.&apos; Illius can only refer to Cluen-
tius, the defendant ; the pronoun hic (which is more usual for him) being
bespoken already. Ry. at the end of his note implies that illius = Vidi,
as does P. in his translation (though not in his note). This is certainly
wrong : we shpuld have had eius, or no pron. at all, had Num. Cluentius
been nephew of Vibius. It remains to inquire who this sister of Cluen-
tius and her son were. ( i ) She is not the daughter of Sassia by A.
Aurius Melinus, for that daughter married Oppianicus minor (§ 179), and
therefore could not have had a son called Num. Cluentius. (2) Was she
a daughter of Sassia by Oppianicus maior ? No such daughter is men-
tioned : and the name again forbids it. (3) Probably this sister is Cluen-
tius&apos;s own sister Cluentia, who was two years married to A. Aurius
Melinus (§ 14), and may have borne him this son. Why then is the son
not called Aurius, like L. Aurius (§ 25)? One reason may be suggested.
His mother may have been divorced defore his birth from A. Aurius
Melinus. So he took his mother&apos;s nomen, and the praenomen of the sons
of Dinaea, his father&apos;s kinswoman, an uncommon one, as we see from Sest.
§ 82, where one Numerius Quinctius Rufus escapes the hue and cry
&apos; gemini nominis errore,&apos; Numerius being known to some people only as a
praenomen, to others only as a nomen. On his father&apos;s side he must have
been connected with Vibius. It is noticeable that such a son ranks as
an eques.

13. ex edicto praetoris : the succession to the property of an in-
testate was originally determined by the laws of the Twelve Tables ; modi-
fications, however, were introduced by various Praetorian Edicts. Ry. R.
Ant. p. 264. [The edictum perpetuum of the praetor was a manifesto
published upon his entry upon office, stating the legal principles upon
which he proposed to base his official action. A new praetor naturally
adopted in its main features the edict of the outgoing praetor, adding per-
haps something of his own. Thus by this &apos; quasi-legislation &apos; of succes-
sive praetors the edictum perpetuum (&apos;standing edict &apos;) or translaticium

suggestion of Mr. Davies, that these words should be transposed to § 1 70,
where they would refer to the elder Oppianicus. Taking them as they
stand, the meaning of the clause cum ille verbum . . . potuerit is far from
certain. (i) It should mean &apos; at a time when he could not have opened his
mouth in this very case,&apos; being a minor. But Cluent. might have wished
to guard against future contingencies. (2) &apos; Since he could not (then or
now) utter a sentence in his own cause &apos; : referring to the infantia (in-
ability to speak) of Opp. minor, which Cic. derides in § 65, te appello,
Oppianice, te, T. Acci ; quorum alter eloquentia damnationem illam,
alter tacita pietate deplorat : (so Man.). (3) &apos; Because he could not have
the shadow of a case against him,&apos; P. suggests, but this is shirking the
expression. The second rendering is quite the most satisfactory. It
enables us to meet Mr. Davies&apos;s objection, that it could not be denied, even
rhetorically, that Opp. minor was an object of fear to Cluent., and there-
fore, if possible, to be got rid of. Cic. can fairly say, &apos; Opp. minor is no
speaker, and Cluent. could therefore always afford to despise him person-
ally ; again, if you say that at any rate he can afford an advocate like
Accius, and is formidable in that way, I reply, There is always Sassia to
provide accusers when he is gone.&apos; 27. An ut . . . accederet : &apos; But
perhaps the case against him was to retain undiminished its serious
features, and withal to be reinforced by a new charge ? &apos; Here we have
an adversative asyndeton : cp. § 138, populum Romanum sua sponte esse
placatum, hominum seditiosorum vocibus . . . concitari. The whole de-
pends upon the one ut : hence for the sak^ of concinnity we find ut . . .
nihil instead of ne quidquam in the former of the two contrasted clauses.
(We should have expected sua in place of eius ; but the suppressed clause,

sensum doloris. Doubtless Cic. is speaking here as the advocate, not as
the philosopher or religious teacher. But, granting this, from a nian of
high character, such as he was, we expect consistency in esseritials. The
commentators here refer in his defence to the words of § 139, omnes illae
orationes causarum ac temporum sunt, non hominum ipsorum aut patro-
norum, and imply that he here disowns convictions which he held intinia
mente^ with regard to the immortality of the soul and the reality of a
future state, and which he has enunciated in the Tusculan Disputations
(Book i.), in the Somnium Scipionis, the de Senectute^ and the de
Amicitia. But it seems to us that this is not so. All that is alleged here
as to a future state is, that the wicked are not haunted in another world
by Furies and other creations of the popular imagination, but lose in
death their consciousness. One other passage avers the contrary, it is
true, but it is from a speech, not a philosophical treatise : Philipp. xiv.
§ 32, illi igitur impii, quos cecidistis, etiam ad inferos poenas parricidii
luent ; vos vero, qui extremum spiritum in victoria effudistis, piorum
estis sedem et locum consecuti. Both passages are highly rhetorical.
Now of the fate of the wicked in a future world, Cicero seems to say
nothing positive in his philosophical writings. He speaks of the immor-
tality of the soul in general, aud his own intellectual position is best
stated in the words of Tusc. i. § 25, mortem . . . quae aut beatos nos
efficiet animis manentibus aut non miseros sensu carentes ; de Senect. § 74,
post mortem quidem sensus aut optandus aut nullus est : his faith or
pious opinion in the words of de Amic. § 13, neque adsentior eis qui . . .
disserere coeperunt, cum corporibus simul animos interire. He believes,
moreover, that the good are rewarded in a future state. And to this
faith, hesitating as it is, he adheres in his speeches : cp. the eulogy on
Ser. Sulpicius in Phil. ix., especially § 13, gratior illi videtur, si qtti est
sensus in morte, aenea statua futura ; Sest. § 131, si est aliqui sensus in
morte praeclarorum virorum. In Sest. § 47 he states the alternatives just
as in Tusc. i. § 25. Enough has been said to show that Cic. is consistent
as far as he goes. There is no &apos; Ardiaeus the tyrant &apos; suffering the pains
of hell in the Somn. Scipionis. The closing words of that allegory,
adapted from Plat. Phaed. 81 C, cannot be taken very literally : eorum
animi, qui se corporis voluptatibus dediderunt earumque se quasi ministros
praebuerunt impulsuque libidinum voluptatibus oboedientium deorum et
hominum iura violaverunt, corporibus elapsi circum terram ipsam volu-

revertuntur. At any rate there is nothing there about Furies and an
Inferno. As the philosopher had not made up his mind, the orator
might say what he liked. We may condemn him for having, in such a
matter, spoken simply for effect, but the same thing is perhaps not
unknown in modern times. In Rosc. Am. § 67, Pis. § 46, he treats the
story of the Furies which haunted Orestes as a gross presentation of the
terrors of conscience, which are the true punishment of sin. 12. reli-

is sometimes identified with the spirit of the murdered man or woman,
as when Dido says to Aeneas, Omnibus umbra locis adero : dabis,
improbe, poenas {A. iv. 386). So probably here. But more generally
the Fury is a distinct being, the incarnation of the victim&apos;s prayers or
vengeance. 15. quid = quid aliud : v. crit. n.

friend of Opp,, he had, if anything, a quarrel with him.&apos; Adeo is a very
strong etiam here, &apos; and, what is more &apos; ; cp, Rosc. Am, § 113, is inter
honestos homines atque adeo inter vivos numerabitur ? 21. potissimum
qualifies ei, &apos;to him of all men.&apos; * Was it likely {imperf. tense), that he
would choose the man whom he knew to be more or less unfriendly to
himself, and most intimate with Opp., as his confidential agent for his
own guilty schemes, and the deadly peril of his foe ? &apos; — a common use of
potissimum with pronouns : cp. Phil. ii, § 28, cur mihi potissimum
[gratulatus est Brutus] ? 24. Habiti exemplo : he refers to the trial of
Scamander, and q.oxv&amp;^q^qxvX. praeiiidicium against Opp. ; cp. § 49.

173. — 27. Faciliusne . . . posset ? badlypunctuated in many edd,, because
the purport of the sentence is missed. There are two questions, in truth,
the first in three parts : &apos; Could the poison have worked so well if
administered in a solid instead of a liquid? Could it have escaped
detection before being administered and taken ? &apos; The former question is
threefold in expression, and of anaphoric form : faciliusne potuit, latius
potuit, celerius potuit . . . permanare? Facilius, poison in liquid is
easier to take without feeling it ; latius, it diffuses itself more widely

Ithrough the veins of the victim (not as Ry., &apos; through the vehicle in which
it was administered &apos;) ; celeritcs, it operates more speedily. For latius,
cp. crit. n. The same idea, that the poison fills the veins, appears in
Hor. C. i. 37. 28, of Cleopatra—
fortis et asperas
tractare serpentes ut atro
corpore combiberet venenum.

In the other case the poison might long remain &apos;abditum aliqua in
parte panis &apos; before permeating the body of the victim. 31. si esset
animadversum, sc. venenum, * if attention wera called to it.&apos; Not
strictly logical : in that case the question would cease to be one of
degree ; the answer is non falleret, not 7ioti tam facile falleret. Precision
is sacrificed to terseness : the attempt to poison is confused with the
poison itself.

ironical : * Si quid miseros illos ad confitenda etiam quae non commisis-

tormentorum : quum tamen nihil fassi sint, cum acerbo risu illud con-
stantiae causam fuisse dicit orator, quod minime esse potuit, et veram
causam, quam sponte quisque intellecturus erat, reticet innocentiae con-
scientiam.^ (So in effect P.) That is, Cic. gives as reasons for their
adhering to the truth what were really incenti^^s to falsehood. Now no
doubt Class. does not understand auct. advocatortc?7i, or the words homines
honesti^ cet., as simple sarcasm. Nevertheless, unless we are to take atque
vi torm. as a Trapa wpoaSoKiav (which would be quite out of place in an
almost pathetic narrative), the two ablatives are on exactly the same
footing. That is, Cic. is made to imply that the * auctoritas &apos; of these
men was not an inducement to veracity. The whole tone of the chapter
forbids that. (2) The words, if they are to stand at all (about which
V. crit. n.), must be taken as serious. &apos; Influenced by the moral support
of the witnesses, and the very violence of the torture,&apos; which produced
the opposite efifect to that intended by Sassia, and, instead of wringing
the falsehood from them that she wished, made them in dogged spite
adhere to the truth.

tremisco tremo trepido with acc. of object. Such sense-constructions are
commoner in Greek : e.g. iKTrXayTJvat with acc. Cum iam tortor

32. optare, * the active formation of a wish &apos; (Ry.) is not a mere synonym
of velle. It is * to set one&apos;s heart on something &apos; which one has chosen :
cp. Hor., optat ephippia bos, piger optat arare caballus {Ep. i. 14. 43) :
also the climax in § 188, voluerit optaverit cogitaverit effecerit. Hence
we have velle atque optare, but struere et moUri : the latter being two

it is a confusion between the fact (in quo esset) and the thinking or

an auction, a fine saw, curved in shape, crooked, and with teeth on every
edge.&apos; A singular tool : but for that very reason, valuable in supplying
circumstantial evidence : it had left its own mark in the bottom of the
chest. However, Mr. Davies reads * aduncam ex omni parte serrulam &apos; :
and supposes Cic. to have mixed up in his description the action of two
tools, both indispensable : the brace-and-bit and the saw. The former
bores the hole to start from ; it consists of a bow-shaped frame, on the
top of which one hand is placed, while the other hand, holding it in the
middle, revolves it round the bit (as axis), which fits into the lower end of
it. The bit has two teeth curving outwards on either side of the diameter ;
and this, according to Mr. Davies, is the reference of aduncam^ while
ex onini parte is &apos; sheer ignorance &apos; on Cic.&apos;s part. [The brace-and-bit is
not mentioned in BlUmner&apos;s Technologie. — H. J. R.]

AB, brace. BCy bit.

18. coactores, &apos; collectors &apos; of revenue or money due after an auction :

father of Horace :

mercedes sequeier. (..9. i. 6. 86. )

21. According to Donatus, indicatis qui de se volens aliquid et de aUis
etiam prodit : sed confitetur qui de se tantum, et qui invitus (ad Ter.
Adelph. prol. 5). For a spontaneous confession as to oneself the
strongest word is profiteor : Caec. § 24, confitetur, atque ita hbenter con-
fitetur, ut non solum fateri, sed etiam profiteri videatur.

Multorum i^nprobitate belongs to interclusa as well as to depressa. The
chiasmus should be observed (depressa veritas, defensio interclusa) com-

placed first as common to both clauses, and the verbs being placed last
in their respective clauses. Cp. § Z^ n. 19. ad fraudem, &apos; in respect

with Opp. quarum iUa, cet., &apos;by contracting which — but not until she

had taken securities of him in his sons&apos; Hves — she made her new home a
house of mourning, and signed the death-warrant of her stepsons &apos; — in ex-

poison.&apos; Here Cic. takes up his words, &apos; iUud primum queror de iHo

enthesis that the attempt was, when first discovered, &apos; matter of mere
suspicion to people in general, and to my client inconceivable,&apos; he is not
admitting that there was any doubt as to the existence of the plot, but
only as to its having existed matre conscia. Graevius indeed supposes an

a later period there were several patroni (three, four, six, and even

twelve) for the defence. Thus Murena was defended by Cicero,
Hortensius, and Crassus. Here vetere = antiquo^ as in §§ 76, 107, 129,
vetus disciplina, and CaeL § 73, voluit vetere instituto . . . industriam
suam a populo Romano ex aliqua inlustri accusatione cognosci. In his
earliest speeches Cic. uses antiquus always in a good sense, vetus generally
in a bad : e.g. Rosc. Am. § 27, vestigia antiqui officii, ib. § 61, veterem
tuam illam calliditatem. (Cp. Bradl. Arn. p. 355 n.) No argument,
however, can be drawn from any such distinction here. For peroravi v.
Gloss. (2) The words have been diiferently taken : &apos; I have pleaded
this case from beginning to end single-handed, as I have been wont to do &apos;
(P.), i.e. &apos;accordingto ;//y old practice &apos;: surely adoubtfulrenderingof z;^/^r^
instituto, although it has the support of Manutius [and Mr. Roby]. Peroravi
in this case probably means *have summed up the whole case,&apos; as opposed
to * singillatim crimina purgare &apos; : cp. its use in Tac. Ann. ii. 30, where
it is said that, a contention having arisen between four persons for the

* ius perorandi in reum,&apos; one of them gains his point by undertaking

* singillatim se crimina obiecturum,&apos; &apos; to bring forward each charge
singly. &apos; And the words would refer to what was now a prescriptive right
of Cicero&apos;s, his always speaking last of the advocates engaged on the
defence. Cp. Mr. Reid&apos;s Introd. pro Balb. p. 14. But this case, in
which Cic. alone is retained, is different from a case such as that of
Sestius, in which (though he perorat) he is retained along with others.
For this and other reasons I prefer (i). The passage is quoted by Pliny
to prove his hypothesis that Cic. epitomised his speeches before publishing.

* Idem pro Cluentio ait, se totam caussam veteri instituto solum perorasse
et pro Corneho quadriduo egisse : ne dubitare possimus, quae per plures
dies, ut necesse erat, latius dixerit, postea recisa ac purgata in unum

heartless to bear that of mother.&apos; scelere ferri : cp. § 12, ferri libidine,

nity as no modern word can do, now that the idea of justice has been
purged of everything emotional, and the rights of the individual are con-
ceived of as something inalienably his, not by grace of some one else,

contrast between the turbulent public meeting and the sedate court of
justice, the former governed by prejudice, the latter sifting false charges
and true, is the characteristic chord which closes, as it began, the speech
for Cluentius.

CRITICAL NOTES.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

In the editions of Cicero&apos;s works issued between the years 1472 and
1826, the latter year being that of the first edition by Orelli, the text of
this speech, which we may call the Vulgate, was gradually constructed. It
is based on the testimony of the majority of extant MSS., supported largely
by that of the editions of Lambinus (the first in 1566, the second in 1584),
Gruter, and Graevius, editors who had among their authorities some MSS.
which have since disappeared.

The edition of Classen, published at Bonn in the year 1831, marks an
epoch in the history of the text of this speech. He was the first to
discover that the mss. whose evidence is wholly or in part available to us
represent two recensions of the text, of which the inferior one had unfor-
tunately gained currency, and he was the first to vindicate the superior
authority of the other recension by a careful collation of its manuscript
sources, which, as far as it went, left little for later editors to do.

The verdict of Classen has been accepted in all essentials by later editors
of Cicero ; that is by Baiter and Halm in their second edition of Orelli&apos;s
Cic. (Ziirich, 1854) ; by Mr. Long in his edition of the Speeches (1856) ;
by Klotz in his successive editions, that of the Speeches (1835), the first
Teubner edition of Cic. (1856), and the second (1882); by Baiter and
Kayser in their edition of Cic. (1860) ; lastly by C. F. W. Muller (Teub-
ner ed. 1885).

The only advocate of the Vulgate text (in its main features) has been
Prof. W. Ramsay of Glasgow, whose edition of the speech has been re-
vised with little or no alteration by Prof. G. G. Ramsay of Glasgow (third
edition, Clarendon Press, 1876). His introduction, especially § 13, should
be consulted for an able defence of the old text against the attacks of
modern editors.

The manuscripts upon which the labours of Classen are based are the
following : —

S (Classen&apos;s A), found in the Royal Library at Munich, whither it had
been taken from Salzburg. It was there collated for Classen at the re-
218

quest of Niebuhr. It is written on large parchment in a beautiful hand,
and belongs to the fifteenth century. Halm has since collated it.

T (Classen&apos;s B), in the Laurentian library at Florence. Collated first
by Lagomarsini, 1748. Niebuhr pointed out to Classen the importance
of its variations from the Vulgate, and this led the latter to make in-
quiries leading to the discovery of MS. from which it differs for the worse
in flaws and omissions.

P (Classen&apos;s C), the Turin palimpsest, was discovered by Peyron in
the Royal Library at Turin, superscribed with a work of St. Augustine. It
consists of 56 leaves of parchment, and contains fragments of ten speeches
and of the Ep. ad Fam. Twelve of these leaves belong to the Cluentiana.
It is probably of no later date than the fifth or sixth century. Classen
found that it sometimes confirmed T, where no other ms. did so. The
parts of the speech for which we have it are always exactly noted below ;
roughly they are —

§§ 1-7 §§ 92-94

18-24 101-103

32-38 129-131

74-78 145-147-

Stray confirmations of the text of ST may be found elsewhere ; in the
references which we have to the Codex S. Victoris in older commentators
(Sylvius, Lambinus probably, and Gulielmus, who collated it), to the
eight Palatine MSS. by Gruter, to the two Codd. Francii by Graevius.
Of these the first-named Codex seems to have been the most valuable.

I have also thought it worth while to note the corrections by a second
hand in b, described by Classen as &apos; Cod. S. Marci, n. 106, Lagomarsinii 6,
chartaceus. &apos; • They represent an early emendation of the Vulgate recen-
sion from the better recension, and are a testimony to the latter of some
value.^

Besides these Mss. there are others less authoritative, and representing
on the whole the Vulgate recension. These are —

F (Classen&apos;s d), fifteenth century, parchment : described by Class. as
Lagomarsinii i, formerly in the Library of St. Bartholomew at Fiesole.
Without lacunae.

M (Classen&apos;s p), eleventh century, parchment ; Lagomarsinii 64, in
Longobardic characters : in the Laurentian Library. Has lacunae.

Miiller refers to another MS. which he describes as Cod. Helmstad.
n. 304. Its readings are to be found in Wrampelmeyer (Progr. Clausthal,
1881), and are generally those of FM. I have referred to it occasionally
asW.

The quotations in Quintilian and the grammarians, which are numerous,
will be found worthy of attention (v. especially §§ 15, 32, 166, 167).

In the notes which follow I have attempted almost nothing in the way

of original emendation. Their aim has been to supply the student with
data sufificient to enable him to form an independent judgment on the
vahie of the chief mss. and on the variants which they supply. Some
prominence has been given to considerations which, it is thought, do not
always receive the attention due to them. These are, in the first place,
the value of a parallel passage in confirmation of any given reading, par-
ticularly if it be taken from the same speech or a speech belonging to the
same period of the author&apos;s literary life. This principle is illustrated in
the notes on § i8, reticeri^ §58, ut videreiur, § 78, Staieno, § 112, quaero,
and elsewhere. In the second place, grammatical considerations, or
rather considerations of Ciceronian grammar, may turn the scale some-
times. Cp. the notes on § 9, ni ; § 33 (the &apos; vivid construction &apos;) ; § 122,
iubeo, with simple infin.; § 141, et ipse, etc. Thirdly, there are rhetorical
considerations, such as the pointing of an antithesis. Examples will be
found in § 16 {matre repeated), § 32 {plures rejected as a piece of false
antithesis), §§ 146, 157, and so on. These and other considerations will
be found, I think, as a general rule though not invariably, to make for
the text of ST, to which accordingly I have on the whole adhered.
Unfortunately we cannot rely impHcitly on ST, or even on P ; all three are
capable of glaring blunders.

Lastly, the student may, if he has the mind, gather instances of most of
the errors and confusions common in mss. in the course of a careful exam-
ination of the text of this speech. For example, in §§ 20, 23, 30 we
have instances of the loss of initial e, M, e, respectively after final e, m, e :
this is * haplography. &apos; Compare § 140, quasi si. Again, in § 37, pernoc-
tarat et (FM) is a case of &apos; dittography. &apos; Then again we have the con-
fusion oicum and quain, §§ 68, 181 ; ipso and isto, cum and ta7n, § 140 ;
tit and ne, § 150 ; sit and est, § 148 ; ad and apud, § 171 ; adJmc and ab
hoc, § 183 ; vobis and nobis, § 184 ; superlative and positive, § 202 ; indic.
and subj., §§149, 181 ; act. and pass., § 183 ; sing. and plur., § 196 ; the
confusion of endings -ant and -at, § 72 ; the loss of est after -us, § 181.
These instances are taken at random, but the list might be enlarged and
arranged to form a useful &apos; gradus ad criticen. &apos;

CRITICAL NOTES ON THE TEXT.

Page 1, Inscription. Habito. So SF and almost all others. Avito,
first suggested by Cuiacius, from a mistaken impression that the Florentine
MS. of the Pandects (48. 19, 39) reads thus, and also because the name is
common in Inscr. ; first introduced into the text by Lambinus in his
edition of 1566. But Habitus appears as a Roman cognomen in more
than one Inscr., also in the Fasti Capitolini, thus *A. viBivs c. f. c. n.
HABITVS &apos; (consul of the second half-year a.D. 8). Moreover, it is read in
all Mss. of Quintilian in iv. 2. 16, v. 10. 68. (V. Bait. crit. n. ad § 201.)

I. I. — The Turin palimpsest (P) contains § i to &apos; quam aequum iudicium &apos;
in § 7. 4. alteram, P.

2. — 10. pars est ea quae, STM ; pars quae, F. The et in the text is

quoted by Baiter. This reasoning &apos; is by no means convincing. It
is quite true that the jurors voted by ballot, but this circumstance would
not preclude discussion &apos; [Ramsay]. The sentence contains a careful
antithesis, * In the matter of direct charges, your practice is to throw the
whole (omnem) burden of refutation upon the advocate : in the matter of
prejudice, to supplement the advocate&apos;s imperfect statement from your
own duly debated convictions&apos;&apos; (this is the sense of * inter vos disceptare,&apos;
which is chosen in preference to * iudicare &apos; in order to contrast
independent activity of mind with mere receptivity : inter vos)(a
nobis). I therefore follow Class. and Ry. in reading omnem . . .

Bait. , Ry. have adopted (also Kays. , bracketing). Klotz^ has &apos; praeteri-

&apos; Neque a me neque animo adesse veHm ; satis est requiratis. Certe
causa perorata testes interrogabantur, non defensor. Suspicor a me esse
glossam ad v. praeteritum, deinde animo subiectum ex praecedente

aperte, to contrast with taciti above. But this cannot be got out of the
reading animo. The remedy may be, either to prefix aequo (as Klotz),
or to expunge animo. I would suggest omnlno as a possible correction,
meaning &apos; by all means.&apos; omnino, written omino, might become omino,
then onimo : and this (a vox nihili) could be emended animo. In § 17,
animum and omnium are variants for hominum.

latter reading may seem the more symmetrical, answering to contra
damnatum et mortuum. But the repetition of the preposition really
contributes to the clearness of the antithesis : incolumi ei vivo might
readily be taken for one of Cicero&apos;s duplicate phrases, in which the idea
conveyed by two words is a single one. Just below (1. 26) the preposition
is similarly repeated : cp. § 3, 1. 5 n. : a writer is apt to fall into the
same form of expression twice : cp. § 9, 1. 7, with § 10, 1. 18. 24. hic

Cluentius had already suffered a similar reverse, is conclusive.

Lambinus read convicta, Graevius convincta (which he thought he
saw in his Mss.), doubting the abl. construction of coniuncta, which is
proved by Phil. v. § 20, and other ref. V. commentary. 12. in omni
causa, ST, cod. Lamb., Class., Bait., Kays,, MUIL, Kl. ; nominis causa,
R, Or., Ry. Quintilian {Declam. ccclxxxviii. p. 790) omits. Nominis
causa can only be defended on the principle &apos;potior lectio difficilior. &apos;
Ry. defends it on three other grounds : (i) &apos; Although the expression &quot; in
omni causa,&quot; in the sense of &quot;in tota hac causa &quot; may be defended, this
use oi omnis is rare, especially in Cic&apos; (2) &apos; Nominis causa affords a plain
and satisfactory meaning.&apos; (3) &apos; In the first part of the sentence Cic. takes
credit, as it were, for his forbearance in consenting, even for form&apos;s sake,
to give her the appellation of mother, and then adds that this forbearance
on his part will in reality tend to make her guilt appear more odious.&apos;
Argument (i) is nugatory, for the occasional use of omnis =\.o\xi^ is not

If

Afn, § 143, haec omnis oratio. Arguments (2) and (3) may be taken

together. Nominis causa could not mean &apos; for form^s sake &apos; (dicis causa).

If we are to accept it, Orelli&apos;s interpretation (ap. Classen) is the true one :

quam aliter nominare non possim,&apos; &apos; for want of a better name.&apos; Then

e enim of 1. 15 is decisive against this reading. For Cic. is made to

y, &apos; I will call her mother, because I do not know what else to call the

lationship (it adheres to her through all) : for the name of mother is

the most effective which I can select for my purpose — to excite your

^ljorror.&apos; Also the repetition of mater in the first part is pointless unless

^H^ is more than a &apos; name.&apos; With in omni causa all is clear and coherent.

^HEmesti and Lemaire bracket the words nominis causa, regarding them as

bracketing non libidinis. 10. Pluygers would excise omnium, which
Graevius had already done on the authority of two codd. But Qiiint. iv.

que, from which Class. conjectures nam quae : R giving ne quam, which

recovery of the true text : which is supported by § 51, si . . . hominum
periculis non defuissem ; § 157, ut omnis mihi cura et opera posita sit in
hominum pericuhs defendendis. Cicero says that he, professionally
conversant as he is with the natural feelings of humanity, is the last man
in the world to ignore the natural sentiment, that the case of a son against
his own mother should not be pressed. But if we read quum . . . amici,
the argument tells the wrong way : &apos; on an occasion on which I am

called in for the defence of a friend (and therefore might be justitied in
giving Sassia no quarter).&apos; There is force in the repetition of hominum ;
it gives the key-note of the argument. Cicero nowhere speaks of Cluen-
tius as &apos; amicus. &apos;

codd., Class., Bait., Kl., Kays., Mlill. ; perfectum, F, which Ry. adopts,
explaining thus — &apos; conjlatum is the crude metal heated in the furnace
in order to be forged or smelted, perfectum the finished work produced
from it.&apos; But here the point to be asserted is that Sassia originated,
was at the bottom of, every one of her son&apos;s trials : for this sense
of conflatum (with which profectum is synonymous), cp. explan. n.
on § 9. The variant perfectu?n may be due to the slight harsh-
ness in the double use of a matre with the two participles, * by &apos;
and &apos;from.&apos; 8. sed vero (ST and inferior codd.) sic agitur (SF),
ut prorsus reticeri nuUo modo possit (ST) : so Class., Bait., Kays.,

agit (TM) ut prorsus reticere (R) non possit, which Ry. adopts, explain-
ing it to mean &apos; but Sassia is acting in such a manner that in no way is he
able altogether to refrain from pubhshing her guilt&apos; — which is satisfactory
as far as the sense goes ; yet in smoothness and finish it seems unworthy
of the highly-wrought passage in which it is imbedded. Agii indeed has
good MS. support ; but the change of agitur tit into agit ut is easily ac-
counted for ; the gloss ea would then creep in (which reads like careless
writing after the ea in the preceding line, which is in a different case : and
illa is wanted). The impersonal reticeri is supported by the similar words
in § 17, de turpitudine matris dici vix oportere. 12. Madv. (Append.
disp. de Asconio, p. 49 sqq.) conjectures illa omnis testium copia. If any
change were needed, it would be better, with Kayser and Miiller, to bracket

factory) Madvig&apos;s emendation posse arbitraretur is on syntactical grounds
indispensable. (Cp. his similar emendation in § 133.) Edd. have gene-
rally (Bait., Kays., MulL, Kl.) preferred Weiske&apos;s conjecture potuisse
arbitretur, which is confirmed by one Laurentian codex (Classen&apos;s a), and
adapts itself better to the preceding quis est. A variant arbih-arentur for
arbitrentur appears in Caec. § 5 : so too in §§ 96, 1 56 of this speech.

27. — 8. domum, omitted by several inferior codd, ; two of the Palatine
Mss. have dexteram according to Gruter, who suspects that the true read-
ing is some third word such as villam. Baiter, referring to § 188, Aurium
Oppianici esse opera proscriptum occisumque, finds additional reason for
doubting the MSS. : Aurius perished neither by the hand nor in the house
of Oppianicus. But this is, as Ry. says, hypercriticism. Cicero is speak-
ing as an orator, not as a historian. The expression criticised is only a
more highly-coloured rendering of the words of § 199, domum illam . . .
scelerum omnium affluentem. 10. se, om. T. iis, S ; Ms, R.

II. domo is suspected by Pluygers as fauUy alike in sense and syntax.
What Oppianicus did was to make room in his house by the murder of
his sons, and this, according to Pluygers, is scarcely expressed by &apos; donio
remedium quaerere &apos; : he suggests continuo. Orelli also suspected corrup-
tion here, and suggested quoquo modo. 14. Pappia, ST. 16. Teano,

much in its favour, and &apos; may be interpreted so as to give additional
force to the passage &apos; : he rejects it on the ground that the meaning given
is &apos; too subtle for a public speaker addressing a jury.&apos; A subjective test
of this kind does not go very far : the subtleties with which §§ 28 and 32
close are surely more refined. (In §§ 47, 127 we have similar instances
of the loss of non in mss.) The gist of the whole passage is this :
Magius had an inkling of Oppianicus&apos; intentions, and provided accord-
ingly. But how inadequate his precautions proved to be ! His utmost
foresight was short-sighted in the face of such enterprising villainy. There
is a general parallelism between the sentences : quia . . . ascripsit —
expressing the precautions of Magius — is answered by quid . . . appel-
landa est, expressing the audacity of Oppianicus. 23. Pkiygers suggests
nondum debitam, as in better keeping with praesentem. The money
was only due after the deHvery of the woman.

inter allegatos, FM, for which Turnebus conjectured alligatos. The read-
ing in this passage has been hotly disputed by generations of scholars. ( i )
inter allegatos, though undoubtedly false, has the support of Ramsay. It
has been explained ; {a) by Manutius as = noce^ttes, &apos; those whose names
were brought forward (by Avillius as informer).&apos; But this use of the word
is post-Augustan, as Ry. points out ; [b) by Sylvius 3iS, = adhibitos, &apos; called
in&apos; to murder Asuvius. Orelli&apos;s explanation is similar: &apos; eos qui ad Avil-
lium de occidendo Asuvio ab Oppianico adornati sunt &apos; : in fact &apos; the
agents of Oppianicus.&apos; He connects inter allegatos with primum Opp.
nomen, &apos;first among his own agents,&apos; a construction like primtis inter
pares ; {c) Gronovius (ad Liv. xxxvi. ii)bringsout the force oi allega-
tos better ; allego being to &apos; depute a person or persons to treat with
another person as intermmtius &apos; : he states that allegati is a legal term for
&apos; persons employed to take down a deposition,&apos; who thereby are them-
selves constituted testes. (This he admits is not certain : his authority,
Isid. V. 23, has alligati.) He connects inter allegatos with constabat.
(2) inter alligatos : &apos; criminis obnoxios,&apos; &apos; culpae adfines,&apos; according to
Turnebus. * Among those implicated in the crime. &apos; This meaning can
be amply illustrated (v. Glossary), But as Class. says, &apos; participium alli-
gati, quum non constet, quinam sint isti homines, abrupte nimis positum
videtur.&apos; Hence (3)alligatum, thereadingofST, Bait., Kays., Kl., Miill.,

quae ad eam rem dabatur, in manibus Scamandri, liberti Fabriciorum,
deprehenditur. So Or. Bait., Kays., Kl., Miill. follow ST.

We must compare § 49, cuius in manibus venenum deprehenderat; § 53,
Scamandrum cum veneno pecuniaque deprehensum. If we are to make a
consistent story out of these passages, wemust suppose (in spiteofClassen)
that both the poison and the purchase-money were found upon Scamander.
[V. explan. n. for force of dabatur.&apos;] As Ry. says, the money without the
poison would have been no proof of guilt ; and (§§ 50, 56) the deprehensio
veneni was the grand charge against Scamander. Cicero may mean that
Scamander had received the poison from Diogenes, and was on the point
of paying for it when the witnesses rushed on him.

Ry.&apos;s reading no doubt is the clearest statement of the circumstances.
But we have no right to insist on so clear a statement in face of the Mss.
If the statement in the true reading is confused, it is either because Cic. feels

234 CRITICAL NOTES. [xvi. 48

it unnecessary to be precise in every mention of the story, or more likely
liecause he has his reasons for vague language, such as &apos; venenum diebus
paucis comparatur &apos; (which does not tell us how the poison was bestowed).
As Mr. Peterson observes, there is another unexplained point : Diogenes
had been solicited to administer the drug himself to Cluentius ; why was
he selling it to Scamander ?

put down to the carelessness of copyists. Its existence in Lucr. is un-
doubted : auct. ad Herenn. ii. § 47, gives quidqicid (quicquid) for quicque

marginof cod. S. Vict., Lamb., Class., Bait., Kays., Kl., Miill.; om. FM,

indispensable, as rounding off the previous sentence. Cicero has started an
ironical cavil at the dispensations of Nature : &apos; It is very hard that, whereas
in bodily diseases the niore serious the complaint the more competent is the
physician called in, in trials, where a man&apos;s civil existence is in jeopardy,
the more serious the indictment the more incompetent is the advocate
retained.&apos; So far there is nothing to show that Cicero is not in earnest ;
but the opening words of the following clause {nisi forte), with their ten-
tative soltition of the difficulty (which involves its real explanation), make
it impossible to mistake the banter of the passage, which is aimed of
course at the unfortunate Caepasius — * but perhaps the reason is that
doctors have only to supply skill, advocates both skill and moral support
(and the latter only a low-class advocate will give to a shady case).&apos;

&apos; though he did this (that is, stabbed his cHent&apos;s reputation) to the best
of his power &apos; : but Cic. could not have attributed to Caepasius a
deliberate design to damage his own case. Nor can sedulo mean *in
good faith &apos; ; if it could, we might get a fair sense from the reading of R.

236 CRITICAL NOTES. [xxi. 59

That reading, however, can be accounted for : some copyist, unfamiliar
with the absolute use of sedulo facere, introduced hoc as object. Class.
illustrates the usage by quotation : Ter. Eun. ii. 3. 71, faciani sedulo,
dabo operam, adiutabo. A sentence in Rosc. Am. § 59 (in context which
has other points of contact with the present passage) is very similarly
constructed, and supports the reading in the text : postea quam invenit
neminem eorum . . . ita neglegens esse coepit, ut . . . resideret, deinde
spatiaretur, nonnunquam etiam puerum vocaret . . ., prorsus tit vestro
consessu . . . pro summa solitudine ahUeretur. 13. accusationi,

omnino haec varietas suspicionem mihi commovet, has voces esse

in the Imperial period. (V. Prof. Wilkins on Hor. Epist. ii. i. 56.)

which the same idea repeated in a sHghtly different form is introduced

supposes that the former reading is due to the mistake of a scribe who,
taking ^(^/w for a subst., glossed it with donis. But there are limits to
the stupidity of scribes, though not, perhaps, to that of the editors who
punctuated thus — donis, datis, mtmeribusque, because Cicero should
otherwise have written donis muneribusque datis. It is more likely tliat
a scribe, unfamiliar with the phrase dona et mimera, corrected to datis
muneribus : mtmerihus alone would have been better, or donis mimeri-
husque ; cp. § 190, accusatorem . . . donis muneribusque . . . obstrinxit.
Dona et munera, donum munus, were legal phrases : e.g. there was a
law of L. Cincius de donis et muneribus {de Orat. ii. § 286). Ulpian
distinguishes donum from munus, as genus from species. 32. fautore,

Juv. X. 22, being compared. Class. objects to each of the latter readings,
saying that luiserrimis as an epithet does not suit locis, nor inanissiiiuis
Staienus : he fixes the error at et^ and writes miserrimus in locis [et]
inanissimis, for et would naturally be inserted when miserriimis was
changed to -is. (But how is the reading of T to be accounted for in that
case?) Class. however offers a conjecture : miserrimus in locis exinani-
tissimis (this word occurs Verr. ii. 5. 104, leg. agr. ii. § 72). Ernesti
conjectures loculis, and Kays., adopting it, conjectures and writes,
miserrimus in loculis ante inanissimis. This is a somewhat violent
remedy. [Yet it retains miserrimtis, which is well authenticated, and rids
us of the dubious plural locis^ as to which v. explan. n. If we were to
read miserrimus oliin loculis inanissimis, it would be easy to deduce the
variants from this original, and miserrimus would have its necessary
qualification in poinl of time — ^ oftce so wretched.&apos;] It is no doubt
strange that the reading of S, so simple, should have been thus perverted
in the Mss. ; the termination of the adj. miserrimis was perhaps confused
with the nom. terminations of the adjectives preceding : perhaps also the
apposition of m. in locis to domi suae was misunderstood by the scribe.
The further progress of corruption is clear : miserrimis becoming
miserrimus, &apos; then inanissimis was altered to agree with it, and finally in
locis was left out to make sense of the corrupted words,&apos; Ry. (For the

is tempting, because it preserves the metaphor ; but in what sense can
i\iQ jurors be said to track the ^profectio^ of the bribes? this is surely
the work of the orator : vobis iudicibus, on the other hand, contrasts the
equity and calmness of the present occasion with the &apos; invidia iudicii
luniani.&apos; So § 88, hodierno die primum veritas vocem contra invidiam
his iudicibus freta misit. Prof, Nettleship has suggested indicibus

praetor . . . utrum admonitus an . . . qua est ipse sagacitate in his
rebus, sine duce uUo, sine indice, pervenerit ad hanc improbitatem,
nescio. This reading ingeniously reconciles the two variants. It is
exposed to Classen&apos;s objection. But that objection is not fatal. Cic. is
not speaking precisely : the jury, as such, could not be said to have spent
eight years in sifting the charge against Ckientius, nor the counsel (as we
should have to understand nos, cp. § 3, 1. 22) to be now concerned to
unearth the offender, Cic. is merely saying in general terms that the
public {nos) looks to the jurors, as men who are quaHfied to lead opinion,
to give the only verdict possible.

it must be more thorough-going than this. We might consider Staienum

version of the second half of the sentence : air qui {qjiam ?] pecuniam

note, which is too long for transcription here, should be consulted. The

conciliationis et gratiae is inopportune : so much so that Manutius
expunged &lt;?/, and Orelli bracketed it. The phrase dare fabula^n should
properly mean &apos; to put a farce upon the stage &apos; : thus (as Ry. suggests) the
words of § 86, illud quod tum explostun atque eiectum est, would be anti-
cipated. But the sense xo.oyivc^^s, fingere fabulam^ &apos; to concoct a story.&apos;
The motive for the interpolation is to be found in the desire to relieve
the phrase admonitus excogitavit, which is quite intelligible — &apos; worked

cihation with Opp. But the obstacles to reconciliation clearly begin at

writes Madv., Appendix ad Disp. de Ascon. p. 45 ; adding that had Cic.
meant to represent Sassia&apos;s enmity as an insuperable obstacle, he must have

pecuniam quam St., qui causam nusquam eadem 1. d. : explaining
&apos; though acquitted, Falcula no less than St. might have received a bribe,
ob rein hid. ; Staienus, however, was never accused for having received
such a bribe.&apos; Ravius&apos; emendation (adopted by Klotz), iudicandam
pecuniam qua capta nusquam St. eadem 1. d. is nearer to the mss.,
but harsher in expression. The reading adopted in the text is taken
from Madvig, Adversaria, iii. p. 127. There cannot be much doubt
about the general sense of the passage. It is as follows : —

Falcula was brought to trial twice : on the first occasion, for having
acted inforrnally as juror on the trial of Opp. : this time he was acquitted
at the first hearing. * I waive this first acquittal,&apos; Cicero says : &apos; that he
was cleared upon that count is no proof, I admit, of his innocence of the
other charge (pecuniae ob rem iud. captae). [Then what of the second
trial of Falcula ? It is important, for] Staienus was not tried on the
direct issue of judicial corruption, of which the court which tried him
(maiestatis) had no cognisance. But Falcula was thus tried : and was
triumphantly acquitted.

Taking the reading of F, the corruption must be localised at captam
nusquam. The supposed transition (at nusquam) from the first trial
of Falcula to the second (expressed in the above paraphrase by the words
in brackets), is one impossible in any argument intended to be intelligible.
We may do one of three things : (i. ) make the best of the reading which
F suppHes. Ry. does this, punctuating and supplementing thus —
accepisse tamen ob rem iud. captam. Nusquam, cet. &apos; Even although
he may not have been guilty of the ofifencc with which he was
first charged, . . . it is still very possible that he may have received
a bribe in his capacity of a juror. Staienus, upon whose conviction
so much stress has been laid, was nowhere impeached under the same
law (eadem lege) as Falcula \on his second trialY The objectlons to
this are : (a) the impossible transition aforesaid ; {b) the tautological

248 CRITICAL NOTES. [xxxvii. 104

accepisse captam ; {c) the use of the bare dixit for causam dixit (though the
technical dixervnt, § 73, might be held to justify this). The last is met
if, with Prof. G. Ramsay, we punctuate at iudicandam, and read causam
for captavi ; cp. 1. 18 stcpr. (ii.) We may hope to find an adequate emen-
dation without abandoning the Mss. altogether. Madv. has given us a
brilliant conjecture : causam nusquam Staienus ea de re lege dixlt.
He explains — finita prioris Fidiculanii absolutionis commemoratione, Cic.
antequam ad alteram transeat quani proprie ad rem pertinere dicit, rei
praeparandae causa breviter interponat, in Staieno huiusmodi iudicium,
quod proprie ad captae pecuniae crimen pertineat, nullum factum esse.
Madv. argues that the lege in his reading is not superfluous : Staienus in
his trial for maiestas had not to answer directly &apos;(legitimo iudicio) foi&apos;
corruption {captae pecuniae) : yet it is hinted that the suspicion of his
criminality under the latter count did him little good as regards the proper
charge which he had to meet. While adopting this conjecture, I feel that
it labours under the same objection as the others in the difiicult transition
which it assumes. (iii.) We may, with Classen, suppose that there is in
this passage &apos; gravius mendum quam quod leni medela tollatur.&apos; So
apparently Kayser, who in his critical note suggests that some such words
as these have dropped out after iudicandam : pecuniam, ut ille, qui
maiestatis est damnatus, cum iudex pecuniam accepisset. Causam
tamen nusquam [Staienus] ea quidem lege dixit. Any such suggestion,
if embodied in the text, amounts of course to original composition under
the name of Cicero. It may be allowable if kept in a critical note. The
argument, as I conceive it, could be briefly expressed as follows : ac-
cepisse ob rem iudicandam pecuniam. At videamus alteram [sc. abso-
lutionem]. An usquam Staienus eadem lege dixit ? (Or, Nam causam
nusquam St, e. 1. d.) Thus the transition is clearly marked. The fre-
quent repetition of the syllable -am might account for the confusion of the
text. Staienus, far from being doubtful (as Class. and Kays. suggest), is
indispensable here, to contrast with Fidiculanius below. 31. crimen,

preclude a personal construction. (Of course it is the presence of the infin.

stabunt is perfectly regular). An ex. from Livy xli. 20. 2, ut nec sibi nec
ahis, quinam homo esset, constaret looks like a case of constare personal
with predicative extension, and the influence of analogy in determining
construction is not to be denied. I therefore keep constarent.

foul play, the facts of which were shortly afterwards made public ; and

culty, which Mr. Davies has rightly discovered, may be met otherwise
than by declaring the received text &apos; perfectly unintelligible,&apos; and disturb-
ing the natural connection of paulo posterius patefacta re ; which also, in

go, ignorantia would express a quahty of mind, in the most general way :

to keep the Act. Inf. throughout : which may be used after iubeo without
an accus. subject expressed, e.g. Catil. iii. § 20 (haruspices) iusserunt
simulacrum lovis facere, where consulentes must be suppHed, leg. agr. ii.

scripserunt, S; reliquissent, R, vulg., Ry. (reliquisse se subscripserunt,
Kays., Kl., Miill., but v. n. on § 36, 1. i). Classen objects to the vulgate
reading on the ground that the mere leaving a man among the aerarii—
where he was before — would have been no stigma ; subscripserunt, they
drew attention to the fact that they had done so — (of course this argument
falls to theground if we admit that aerariuin relinquere = aeraritimfacere&apos;,
but the evidence for this is insufficient. V. explan. n. on this point) —
Ramsay&apos;s objection to the reading of TF, that suhscribere properly denotes
not the affixing of the nota, but the assignment of the reason for its
affixing, deserves consideration. [Thus Ascon., Cic. in tog. cand., p. 84,
Orell. : hunc Gellius et Lentuhis censores . . . senatu moverunt causasque
subscripserunt, quod socios diripuerit cet. Cp. also § 131, which gives a
specimen of such a subscriptio.^ But the case of D. Matrinius is excep-
tional ; he was not &apos;aerarius factus,&apos; &apos; in aerarios relatus,&apos; but &apos;in aerariis
relictus &apos; : the subscriptio to his name must have been exceptional too,
and have stated Xho. fact as well as the reason (&apos;in aerariis relictus est,
quod . . .&apos;). Then suhscribere may=&apos;state in a subscriptio^ (pregnant
force) as excusare and defendere=^ &apos;sX.^sX^ in excuse, in defence.&apos; If this
does not commend itself, at any rate the reading of S is preferable to the
vulgate. II. dixerunt, STF. Cp. § 121, 1. 14.

(iii.) Madvig {Emend. Liv. p. 698, on xliv. 27. i) reads, combining
these, aut illud adferant, aliquid sese, quod de liis duobus habuerint
compertum, de ceteris non comperisse : which I have adopted. So
Kays., Mlill. Taking (i.) first — As Class. explains it, the line of thought
will be — What is the meaning of this stigma upon Aquihus and Gutta ?
The censors must tell us {dicafit) : it is that two only of the jurors were
iDribed. Or else let them produce evidence [adferant), that the fault
visited by them upon two was committed by the rest. For {nam illud . . .
§ 128), they will not venture to tell us &apos;all were equally involved, but
we arbitrarily selected two for notatioJ This interpretation of aui illud
adferant — comperisse, is criticised by Ry. as inconsistent with * na^n
illud . . .&apos;and what immediately follows. If it is worth our while to
defend an erroneous reading in order to vindicate its many supporters,
we might reply that &apos; 7iam &apos; is elliptic in this case : &apos; Or else let them
argue that while punishing two they knew that the rest were guilty : [but
this alternative cannot be accepted] : for it cannot be allowed that the
censors could have adopted the rough and ready military method of
decimation. &apos; But we should expect idem for aliquid : nor does adferant
seem to be the right word. As to (ii.), the sense given is much the same
as that of (iii.) : the sentence is not so smooth. At the same time it is
not necessary to suppose (with Mr. Peterson) a harsh attraction, non
comperisse for non co77ipereHnt ; nor is the omission of the subject se at
all unprecedented, cp. § 36 n. Co77iperisse would depend directly
on adferant. &apos; Or else let them assert (which would be absurd), that
they have discovered something peculiarly heinous in the conduct of these
two ; that as to the rest, they have not discovered anything. &apos; With (iii. )
all is clear. There are three alternatives : the censors must say that two
07ily were guilty : or else that two at least were guilty, and on the rest they
cannot pronounce. For {7iam illud . . .) a third supposition that,
knowing that all were guilty, they made scapegoats of these two, cannot
be admitted. (This is substantially Ry. &apos;s view : although in his text
he exhibits the MS. reading.) [(iv. ) An emendation by Mr. Davies
{Her77iath. ii. 408), merits mention. He emends the ms. reading with
comparasse for comperisse : translating &apos; else we must suppose that the
allegation is, that the censors had found out material facts about the
guilt of those two persons, and had co7ne to a private agree77ient that the
rest were also guilty.&apos; Co77iparasse, he says, is technical (as in so7&apos;titio et
cot7iparatio) : but we want proof of its absolute use in this sense : unfor-
tunately he says that illustration is hardly required, and proof is super-
fluous. He does vouchsafe Cic. Fatn. i. 9, se paraturum cum collega
*that he would make things straight with his colleague.&apos; This emenda-
ion will not stand against Madvig&apos;s.]

Ry. ; e consuet. Bait., comparing ex re militari, § 129, 1. 18.

and so Kays. Miill. ; sortitione, R. 33. qui . . . deUquerat, ST ; ne
. . . delinqueret, R. The former reading is much to be preferred :
(a) because it gives the best connection in sense between this and the
previous sentence : ^tn . . . deliquerat is parallel to viiles qtd locum
non tenuit : the former sentence states a principle : the latter its illus-
tration in old Ronian practice. (d) It keeps up the parallelism of the
things compared : the offence of the cowardly soldier, as that of the
corrupt juror, /las heen committed : it is not prospective. {c) The time of
the two parts of this sentence quare . . . comparata est is identical. With
the reading ne . . . delinqueret : {a) the connection with the previous
sentence is by no means so easy. It is harsh to take miles generic (*a
soldier&apos;) out of miles qui l. n. tenuit^ *a runaway soldier &apos; as subject to
the verb : yet we must do this with this reading : otherwise iteriim would
be necessary, &apos; lest the runaway should fail again.&apos;&apos; {b) With miles
generic as subject, we must take Ry.&apos;s explanation : &apos; on the one hand,
to prevent a soldier from shrinking from his duty in the fight, they held
up to him beforehand the terrors of condign punishment in the most
comprehensive form ; but, on the other hand, when the offence had
actually been committed by numbers, they had recourse to sortitio.&apos;&apos;
But there is nothing to show that Cic. refers the one clause to the time
before the battle, the other to that after it, and (c) the force of the com-
parison is thus weakened — Mr. Peterson gives a note of Prof. Nettleship :
the reading qui . . . deliquerat &apos;seems to give the sense imperatively
required by the whole passage. &quot; For a soldier who has deserted\i\% post
[tenuit perfect) may be afterwards, nevertheless, a better soldier, etc.
Therefore if a man had behaved badly in war from fear of the enemy, our
forefathers held before him a greater fear — that, namely, of punishment
and death,&quot; etc. The point of the passage is that the decimation takes
place after the act of cowardice, in order to punish a few by death, and
the majority by the terror of death : amplior metus being the agony of
fear endured by the soldiers while waiting to see on whom the lot will
fall. This fear, and the sight of their comrades&apos; punishment, will act
both as a punishment for the past, and a deterrent for the future. But
(he says) there is no real analogy between the soldier who has once shown
the white feather and the juryman who has once given a corrupt verdict :
the one may retrieve his fault, the other is so tainted as to be unfit for
pubhc life.&apos; On this view, amplior is not so satisfactorily explained
(&apos;stronger than his ordinary fear of death in action&apos;): we might, how-
ever, explain it &apos;more comprehensive,&apos; viz. — than it would be, if only one
in ten feared and if there were no sortitio.

LIII. — 6. commovet, P ; commoveret, R. Class. and Ry., adopt-
ing the latter, begin a new sentence (Ry. a new chapter), with quod si
nihil . . . Class. objects to the ordinary arrangement of the sentences
(which I have adopted), on the ground that it makes Cic. speak as if he
based his whole defence on the lex : in fact, on the ground that commovet
states absolutely what commoveret would state conditionally. But
neque evidently introduces the text for a fresh argument — that law exists
not to be discussed, but to be obeyed. Thus the indic. is required, with
a fresh paragraph.

149.— 27. noluit, T ; Lamb. Miill.; nolit, R, Class., Ry., Kl., mss. often
confuse indic. and subj. ; e.g. § 107 fecerunt, §118 possim, § 122 adepti sunt,
§ 144 videbantur, with variants. Here the indic. is better : * whatever else
he may be, he is at all events {tamen) one who has refused to shelter him-
self behind the terms of the law &apos; : the plain statement of a fact. Cp. the
words of § 145, qua hic me uti nokiit. Classen punctuates with a mark
of interrogation at nolit instead of at Cluentius : arguing that the words
qui . . . nolit are inadequate as an answer to the question : but that the
question, if they form part of it, is unanswerable, and as such, an apt
conclusion of the argument. * Who then is this Cluentius (who is no
magistrate, etc. ), although he refuses to stand on the terms of the law?
why, he lege non tenetur. &apos; This is strained : and again, such rhetorical
questions are uncommon in ancient oratory, which generally answers its
own questions. Cp. § 137 n. 31. se, om. ST. But sua . . . se

answer to mea . . . me in next line. Page 58, 1. i. From dicenda
est to quae tunc (§ 154), M is wanting. 6. enim, T ; Kays., Miill. ;

ego, R and other edd. 7. te a me desiderare, ST ; Class., Kl. If
with Class. we referred te to Accius, we should have to suppose the
words to be ironical, &apos;the refutation which you seem so anxious to meet.&apos;
But the sudden transition from Cluentius to Accius, even supposing the
orator to make some gesture in explanation, is almost impossible, especially
as the voc. Acci only appears in the next sentence. For the confusion
of the act. and pass. infinitives, cp. § 122 n.

LV. 150.— II. eiusmodi, ST ; huius modi, R. 13. recusavit ne

cum, Bait. conj., Kays. ; accusavit ut cum, codd,, so Class., Ry. ;
recusavit quin quo, Lamb. and KI. ; recusavit ne quo, Miill. . Below
Ry. (under protest) reads with Lamb. and Or. uti non oportere, which
seems to be simply a conjecture of Man. Mr. Peterson in a note defends
the Mss. reading. But the gain to the sentence in clearness and point is
very great, if we read recusavit [cp. recusatio in § 148, init.] and quo,
while the change from ut to ne may be defended by their not infrequent
confusion in the MSS., e.g. in § 170, and Mtir. § ii ad fin. If we
retained ut, we should need the non of Manutius below : for we can
hardly suppose with Class., that after recuso Cic. would use ut c. subj., as
the equivalent of the simple infin. even when explanatory of hoc : how-
ever, v. explan. n. on § 16, esse faciendum . . . ut, 22. summum,
ST ; in summum, F. In § iio we have in locum ascendere, and else-
where ad : the simple accus. is wanted for petiverunt here, and may be
paralleled from Font. § 4, quae facilius possit Alpes quam paucos aerarii
gradus ascendere. The intrans. construction is commoner.

151. — 33. qua est usus, Manutius&apos; fine emendation of the MSS. reading
quaestus or questus. Lamb. expunged the whole clause, supposing it

262 CRITICAL NOTES. [lv. 152

to be a marginal note, quaestio in vet. iud., altered and foisted into the
text.

152.— Page 69, 1. 8. sese, ST ; se, R. The emphatic form of the
reflexive pron. here answers to its emphatic position, and the somewhat
unusual construction of volunt : v. explan. n. ii. in potestate sua, read
by all Mss. but one, and emended by Man. Cp. § 130, in invidia (most MSS.).
Final -in is in Mss. very evanescent. si constitutum est . . . iudicarent,
all Mss. ; Lamb. first read si const. sit . . . iudicarint, the last word
after Man. : Class. and Ry. retain the MS. reading. Classen argues that
the indic. represents their confident hope (&apos; the certainty they feU,&apos; Ry.),
* qua tanquam factum sibi proponunt quod sperant. &apos; That is, we have si
const. est for si const. sit of strict or. obliqua. But it should be si const. erit,
the 2d Fut. : the Perf. Indic. requires that the action be completed at
the moment of speaking. In fact the tense is the difficulty. The required
correction is a very simple one. Sit and est (written st) are often con-
fused in Mss. Cp. § 148 n. Still less can iudicarent be defended,
explained as * the class of men acting as jurors,&apos; as opposed to the jurors of
any particular trial. The tense is again the difficulty. Contrast the
Pluperf. iudicassent (§ 153), to w^hich a Perf. in primary time (as here)
must correspond. In Mur. § 5, a similar correction is desirable (legem
hanc) ita tuli ut eam quam mihimet ipsi iampridem tulerim . . . non
abrogarim (for -arem of mss.) : there, however, Cic. may look back to
the time of the passing of the law (cp. § 148 stipra, qui . . . convenit
convenerit, quo quis . . . condemnaretur) : here, in the nature of things,
the standpoint of thought cannot be changed to the past.

LVI. 153. — 21. ageret quam cum illa c. q. t. erant nobilitatis, all
the MSS. : early corrected. Graev. objects to the concrete meaning of
nobilitas: but v. cxplan. n. 22. ut ei ciui, a conj. of Halm, so Bait.,
Kays., Miill, : utique, mss. ; uti qui, Man. conj., Class., Ry.
24. ceterique eiuscemodi ordinis, ST ; ceterique huiuscemodi ord.,
R. The occurrence of huiuscemodi four times in two sections would by
itself be suspicious : here, where it is meaningless, it must be false.
Class. suggests equestrisque, in place of ceterique (two mss. have
ceterisque), and would eject huiuscemodi (eiuscemodi), without com-
pensation; Bait., Kays., accept this emendation, which hardly accounts
for the reading of ST. KI., Miill., and Madv. {Adv. ii. p. 200), read
ceterique eiusdem ordinis, which must have repelled previous editors by
its simplicity. 27. recusarent : Madv. Adv. ii. p. 200 conj. reputarent
(so Milll.). He argues that repicgnarent cum recusarent (hoc est repugna-
rent) is tasteless : and that haec after rectis. should be hoc (as referring to
one chapter of the law). But the pleonasm objected to is in Cicero&apos;s style :
and haec reputarent after ut aliquid . . . putarent would be somewhat
misleading. (Man. conj. cum et recusarent.) Page 60, 1. i. After
iudiciorum many edd. give the word anfractu, which apparently would
mean * intricacies &apos; here, but which rests on no MS. authority. Prof.

partly because the parallel passage Rab. Post. § 16 omits — delectat

sacerdotia, triumphi, denique imago ipsa ad posteritatis memoriam
prodita, — but insignia may well denote the lesser ornaments, whether
of the magistrate (as the ivory staff), or the senator (as the calceus
lunatus). In Sest. § 17, it is associated with fasces similarly — se illis
fascibus ceterisque insignibus summi honoris atque imperii ornatos esse.

LX. 165.— Page 64, l. 7. All mss but ST have C. before Vibium.
Cappadocem, ST b (corr.); a cognomen found in two inscrr. : other mss.
have Cauponem or Capacem ; the latter Bait. Kays. adopt. We cannot get
any conclusive arguments from internal evidence. That he stayed at Rome
with a hospes is not evidence that he was not a Roman citizen, but an Asiatic
(Cappadox). He may have been an Italian. Ry. argues that C. Vibius
Cappadox would be &apos; the Asiatic freedman of some C. Vibius, &apos; and no fit
guest for a senator. Is it not equally probable that he was at once an
Italian born, and surnamed Cappadox from some exploit in the Mithra-
datic wars? Vibius is a Samnite name, but one which made its way
to Rome, according to Momms. Unte^-ital. Dial. p. 242. We find a
Sex. Vibius at Larinum, § 25. ii. After mortuus MSS. (except STF
and others) read &apos; aut heres est Cluentius,&apos; emended at (haud Lamb.)
heres est Cluentius by edd. Plainly &apos; haud h. est C was interpolated
by those who thought the transition from est mortuus to intestatum
dico esse mortuum abrupt, if not a vain repetition. But Cic. inten-
tionally repeats and amplifies : . . . intestatum (this is the emphatic word)
dico esse mortuum ; i.e. had Cluentius been a captator or legacy-hunter,
the man would have made his will in time. 13. ex edicto praetoris,

R. Both constructions are Ciceronian : haec quae ego nunc percurro,

100. Intransitive verbs compounded with a preposition often become
transitive in usage : a tendency which, beginning in classical times, is
found in latc-r Latin in fuU development ; e.g. percurro transitive is classi-
cal, percurso is post-classical. The poets did much to confirm this
tendency.

ii. p. 396, suggests that these words belong to § 170, as they make no
sense here : &apos; Why could not the younger Opp. utter a word against
Cluent. in this very trial ? Sure enough he is the prosecutor. It is he
who says everything : everything that Accius pleads. He is at the
moment enjoying and exercising the full rights of a Roman citizen. The
lines refer to the elder Opp. who was an exile, civilly dead, and belong to
the following context § 170, quo tandem metti adductus . . . conatus est?
quid umquam Habitus . . . Opp. inetuebat cum ille . . . accederet ?
Quid erat quod iam Opp. . . . quisquam timeret ? quid metuebat?&apos;&apos; The
four words in italics, he says, indicate the argument. If Cluent. tried
to poison the elder Opp. the probable motive would hefear. Now what
could he fear in him ? In the case of the younger Opp. ih&amp;fear could
not, even rhetorically, be denied. I think I have shown, in the explan.

n., that a fair sense may be got out of these words as they stand. At the
same time it must be allowed that the similarity between the opening
words of § 167 and 170 is singular and perhaps more than accidental. 1
would suggest that we have here two recensions (by Cicero&apos;s own hand)
of the argument as to Opp. the elder embodied in our text : quo tandem
igitur . . . laederetur (§ 170) is a more highly finished version of quid
uttiquam . . . potuerit (§ 167) : the words of § 167 huic autem . . . ac-
cederet may have belonged to either place originally. And it would be
idle to attempt now to unravel what has been woven into a consistent

denique ne aspicere quidem.&apos; Cp. also § 41, a similar climax, adiiu . . .
congressione . . . sermone . . . convivio. Ry. rightly distinguishes respi-
cere and aspicere, the latterly frequently denoting &apos; to see, without imply-
ing any exercise of the will,&apos; the former &apos;necessarily implying a deliberate
act &apos; : and maintains that in the present passage we must prefer the former.
But upon reflection it will appear that aspicere (a mechanical rather than
conscious exercise of the will) gives exactly the sense here wanted — men
would not see Opp. when he stood before their eyes, they &apos; cut him dead &apos; :
whereas respicere would not be nearly so forcible — men would not turn to
look after him. In truth there is rhetorical exaggeration in aspicere. Cp.

Class. describes it) — as confirmatory of the evidence of ST as to a recen-
sion prior to that of the MSS. represented in the vulgate text. In the
present instance, the &apos;second hand&apos; has faithfully (though not intelligently)
altered mortem satis of R to casum minime of ST, and left the negative
non standing : this might easily happen. There is thus no real hesitation
in the testimony of ST and b (corr.). But the rest vacillate between the

Had this person been L. Quinctius the tribune, probably Cic. would have

might argue for the reading of Kayser, C. Quinctium. But the *argu-

former is commoner : where the word is substantival, or participial (as in
the abl. absokite), -e is the abl. ending. Wesenberg (observ. in Sest. pp.

Verr. ii. i, § 97, descensuros polUcebantur and ii. 2, 93, addit . . .

the reading. Though he thinks the omission of the pronoun doubtful in
Cic, he hesitates to deny it altogether, seeing that it is common in Caes.

Cic, which (if we are to accept the testimony of the MSS. as we receive it)

even although it had as yet not been said &apos; : but we want veniret ; and, even
so, what does he gain by saying that he can imagine what viay be said,
when the thing has been said ? (/;) tametsi adhuc non esse dictum
mementote (KL), or t. a. n. esse hoc d. m. (Bait., Kays., Mlill.) : the
parenthesis now has some force, for the thing in question has not been
said before ; and Cic. by this anticipation is cutting the ground from

Though Sassia had repeatedly made the statement during the question by
torture, her counsel had not availed himself of it (v. end of this section).
Ab hoc is opposed to juihi. The corruption adhuc is easy of explanation :

to govern the infin. dixisse, and that the previous questions are in the form
of finite sentences (utrum furtum factum non est ? cet. ). He would there-
fore read cum id vobis dicendum est quod tum S. dictitavit cet.,
omitting quod and et. This is a Procrustean method of dealing with his
author. Why should all the questions necessarily have the same form ?
Into this one a disturbing cause has entered — the verb dicendu?n esi —
which has taken over the government of the rest of the clause by a kind
of attraction, and the use of the infin. instead of the finite verb suggests
that a figment, not a fact, is under consideration. — T has quaereret : act.

obsignarit,&apos; and might have said &apos; dicite qui obsignavit unum aliquem.&apos;
The genesis of the false readings would then be : d. qui obsignavit ii. al. ;
this, being wrongly punctuated, gives dicite quis obsignavit ? and this again,
dicite quis obsignarit.

pendent clause, a kind of gnomic perfect, is allowable in Ciceronian prose
if introduced by a temporal adverb such as mmqua??i^ saepe, from which
indeed it derives its force : otherwise it is only found in dependent clauses
ox passini in poets and prose of the silver age. Cp. Hor. C. iii. 2. 29,

Both forms are used, being genitive plur. of 7ioster, to supply a gen. plur.
of nos (as is also nostri, gen. sing. of noster) : the former however is not
elsewhere found in Cic. , though occasionally occurring in the comic poets.
Kl. quotes Pl. Foen. iv. 2. 39, nam nostrorum nemo dignus est : Liv.

the metaphor deos requires to be softened, not sharpened. Class. had
already conjectured quasi from quos of T. 25. parentium, T, which
would not be the ordinary gen. of this word, except in poetry. But -zun

expunge nomen et, which he supposes to have been inserted by some one
who did not see the antithesis between necessittidines and tiatura, nomina
and iura, and introduced an antithesis of his own, nomina and nomen.
But the text as it stands gives a forcible sense : nomina necessitudinum,
the artificial ties of affinity, are contrasted with naturae nomen et iura, the
maternal relationship of blood which is a law in itself. Also in § 12 we have
naturae nomen. 19. uti, T, and others; ut, R. 20. reservaret, ST.

condicio (verb condico, promise or stipulate ; con, vdic- in dico

contio { = conve7itio, Fest. ep. p. 113, i.e. coventio) : (i) z. public meeting

§ 145 defensionis d. often thus used of iudices : § 107 eius d. quae
in iudiciis publicis versari debet ; the last word shows that d. is moral
here ; § 147, although here meaning (1), &apos; consideration,&apos; might suit :

remembered. When less strictly applied, tr. ^prestige.^ It does
not imply quite so much as the EngUsh &apos; splendour &apos; ; but answers
